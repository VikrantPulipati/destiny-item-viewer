These objects commemorated martial feats and personal victories but varied widely in appearance. Peasant mercenaries often simply stitched the carved teeth of their defeated foes into their leathers; those with more resources sometimes claimed the entire torsos of vanquished opponents to preserve, lacquer, and display as busts.\n\nThe Bell of Conquests was a less grisly chronicle of the victories of its owner. Unadorned bells were given to warriors at their first blood. Those who wished to challenge a warrior in combat would request their bell and ring it seven times.\n\nAs warriors collected victories, they could have artisans decorate their bells to commemorate their glories. These adornments allowed the bearers to call upon benefits for honorable combat related to their past victories: a warrior who had completed the Trial of Beasts could bring a trained war beast into a duel; a survivor of the Flayed Night was allowed to cut their opponent twice across the stomach; those who had withstood the Cold Iron Mouth could coat their blades in caustic white ash.\n\nDefeating the bearer of a war bell entitled the victor to claim the bell as their own. The clapper of the bell would be carved with a shallow engraving representing the previous owner's cause of death. Ownership would fully transfer after the engraving had been worn away by new challengers ringing the bell. At that point, all the privileges the bell bestowed upon its former owner would be granted to the new holder. For this reason, elaborate war bells were both highly sought after and heavily defended.\n\nWar bells continued to be carried into the galactic-colonial period, and their decorations became even more refined. Intricate mosaics pressed with precious gems became symbols of wealth and granted further allowances in duels, while also creating a larger incentive for would-be challengers. As the scale of warfare increased, the logistical difficulties of claiming war bells became apparent. Captured war bells were sometimes melted down en masse and recast as elaborate war gongs, and there were specific rituals in place for spacefaring rivals to ring the gong in challenge.\n\nIn the post-Red War Cabal, few soldiers adhere to the tradition, as the Bell of Conquests is seen as a cumbersome relic. Nevertheless, they may still find a place of honor aboard the ships of those who wish to respect the combat traditions of their ancestors.","name":"Bell of Conquests","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"Hear the seventh strike, calling blades to meet.","hash":2288292550,"index":7,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3624870834":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Currently, our crypto-archaeologists cannot pinpoint the date of Calus's rise to power within the Cabal Empire. Like much of the Cabal Empire's ancient history, many dates and facts were altered to cast a favorable light upon the former emperor and his rise to power. Most of the Cryptarchy's information comes from post-Calus records, scoured from archival remnants on Red Legion vessels and forays into the Leviathan. As such, this record's historic context must be marked with an asterisk for questionable accuracy.\n\nAccording to excerpts from the Cabal legal record known as the Codex of Lawful Transgressions, the Hammer of Proving dates back to the Foundation Age of Emperor Calus's reign. During this era, Cabal society was dominated by militaristic ambition centered around conquest and imperial expansion. As Calus took control of the empire, he sought to steer the Cabal people toward a society of art and philosophy (though this degenerated into decadence and debauchery).\n\nIn the early Foundation Age, the Rite of Proving was the primary means by which disputes were settled among free Cabal (much like how the Crucible was formed among the Guardians of the Last City). During the Proving, two Cabal or their appointed representatives would air their grievances in a public forum and one or both Cabal would declare a challenge. These Cabal would battle one another to submission or to the death—often the latter—and the winner would be seen as the right and lawful party in the dispute.\n\nCalus disapproved, but knew that overturning a centuries-old tradition would be an unpopular decision. Instead, the emperor introduced incrementally draconian and byzantine bylaws into the Proving. One of these stated that if a battle ended with a tie or double-submission, an \"impartial\" imperial arbiter would decide the outcome. This arbiter would carry a symbol of Imperial office: a gold-plated hammer etched with strange runes drawn from Calus's own personal occult obsessions. The Hammer of Proving.\n\nWhereas an impartial arbiter was a widely accepted change to the tradition, Calus abused it to push his own agenda. Over time, the Proving arbiter was granted more and more autonomy to settle battles, eventually gaining the right to enter a battle on their own under a number of flimsy justifications such as balancing \"unfair\" matches, ending matches that went \"overly long,\" or punishing a Proving participant who owed a financial debt to the empire.\n\nThe Proving arbiter became such a disruptive force that within a century, the Rite of Proving had fallen out of common usage, as the law and restrictions around the Rite made it an untenable solution. Ultimately, the role of Proving arbiter was retired and the hammer returned to Calus's vaults.\n\nDuring Caiatl's rise to power, she sought to win over those who had been put off by her father's cynical interpretations of Cabal tradition. Her regime reinstated the Rite of Proving as a simple combat challenge without arbiters or other superfluous trappings, and her adherence to custom gained her the steadfast loyalty of many influential warriors and politicians. This small army of dedicated followers is credited with easing her transition to a place of authority where her self-chosen honorific \"empress\" seems reasonable.\n\nIt is unknown how the Red Legion came into possession of the Hammer of Proving, but the weapon carries a significant historic weight to the Cabal people, one that can be leveraged as both an olive branch and—perhaps most fittingly—a bludgeon, depending on the wielder.","name":"Legacy: Hammer of Proving","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"Forge Challenger Medallions from Cabal Gold to challenge Caiatl's chosen warriors in Battlegrounds.\n\nThe hammer must be equipped to acquire Cabal Gold.","hash":3624870834,"index":8,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"304691679":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Mithrax sat on a carpet in his meager quarters, held the Paradrome Cube in his hand, and concentrated.\n\nHours passed before Eido, concerned, sat beside him.

This allows the bearer to access technological mundanities as well as deeper, infinitely more protected networks, including the Vex domain itself.\n\nOnce connected, access to these networks is severely limited for the Eliksni Sacred Splicers, though Guardians, due to their unique relationship with the Light, are able to manifest corporeally within the network for short periods of time. They can then alter the data found therein with focused percussive energy—including gunfire—in a baffling scientific process the Cryptarchy does not yet fully understand.\n\nThe Gauntlet seems capable of powering itself by transmuting unbound energy into Ether. Traditionally, Sacred Splicers would undertake great journeys to charge their Gauntlets with naturally occurring residual energy, but Guardians can use their martial prowess to convert their foes into bountiful energy sources.\n\nIn closing, the Sacred Splicers merely exploit a tool that induces Light to resonate at frequencies approaching that of the Vex Nexus, enabling them to access to certain low-security Vex systems.

It seeks the spark in you and bolsters its charge, redirecting your innermost power that it may serve as an extension of your will. The staff then acts as a conduit through which one may forcibly deliver peace when such action is required. This seems a contradiction, to be sure. It is not.

The Garden must be left to tend itself, mustn't it? It must be allowed to evolve its secret fruits…\n\nThe terrain dips. The red flowers fade away to low, woven grasses. The wind whispers… soft words, sentences with just the beginnings of syntax, the cadence almost musical. \"Brain stain,\" Jolyon whispers, fearing infection by a contagious idea. \"We should…\" But his voice trails off as Uldren pushes ahead, down into a low vale, slipping easily through tangled undergrowth. Vex. There are Vex here, dozens of Goblins and Minotaurs, still as statues and covered in moss, in a ring like some robotic henge. They are singing in faint, wraithlike notes of inhuman clarity. Uldren knows what this place must be.\n\nThe Cabal Legionary huddles behind a stone. Uldren creeps forward. By the time the wounded bellowing thing knows he's there, he has a knife pressed to its helmet, right above the cleft of its lips and the soft tissues below. \"Don't move,\" he says, in Ulurant. \"Don't speak. This knife is atom-sharp.\"\n\n\"I can tell,\" the Legionary grunts in its native tongue. \"It's roight up in me eyes. Practically shavin' me bristles.\"\n\n\"Do you know where you are?\"\n\n\"Just abou' the worst place anyone's ever gone?\"\n\n\"You say that because you can't smell the air,\" Uldren says. \"It's sweet. Like pollen and thunder. Why did you come here?\"\n\n\"Not by any chance of oir own, ser. The milk robots abducted us.\"\n\nThe whispers have taken on a soft hint of Ulurant grammar, confirming Uldren's suspicion. This is a place where abstract patterns war for survival, fighting to propagate themselves by preying on each other. The Vex are singing to see how the Garden changes their song, and even this conversation has fertilized the air. \"Why are they here? What do they want?\"\n\n\"They come 'ere to pray, ser. They're makin' vessels ou' of themselves. They're the wors' things ever to be, ser. They 'ate existence.\"\n\n\"How do you know this?\"\n\n\"Oh, frum the seeds, ser,\" the Legionary says. \"Do yeh see them?\" And without hesitation or second thought, he punches the emergency medic release on his helmet. The pressure seal breaks and a ring of black gel sprays out, hissing. The Legionary slumps over. His helmet tumbles into his broad lap.\n\nBeneath the layer of gel, the whole surface of his skull has the pitted texture of a strawberry. Thousands of tiny seeds glisten in the Cabal's flesh. Uldren brushes the skin in fascination.\n\n\"Uldren,\" Jolyon radios, \"I really don't like the expression on your face.\"\n\n\"This place has secrets,\" the prince murmurs back. The bone mic feels cold and inorganic, poorly mated to his flesh, compared to the warm, close-packed pits of the Legionary's deformed skull. \"So many secrets… They grew in him, Jolyon. The Garden grew its secrets in him.\"\n\n\"Who gives a rat?\" Jolyon snaps. \"Your Highness, we've got to get out of here. Before whatever happened to them happens to us too!\"\n\nHe's afraid of secrets, Uldren realizes. The unknown terrifies him. Which is very sensible. Very rational.

Huge wet fruits slapped against his shoulders and detonated in overripe pulp. Fruits shaped like heavy, swollen Ghosts. He was huddled with Jolyon beneath a thick cobweb, holding his breath, as they listened to voices argue just outside. His heartbeat… was it his heartbeat? Or another's?\n\nHe was in an apartment block. He remembers that. He was sitting in the laundry room, a place with a black-and-white checkered tile floor, watching his crows tumble over and over in the dryer, black feathers flurrying, beaks clacking. A big old female Cabal sat in the tub to his left, scrubbing her back with a wire brush. A Vex Goblin with the face of Alis Li in its stomach stood behind the counter, selling detergent. \"Uldren,\" she said, \"you've got a hole in you.\" The Cabal grunted in agreement. He looked down at himself and there was a hole in his hand, black and perfectly round. His dryer ran out of time, but his crows were still wet.\n\n\"Uldren.\" Mara, shaking him. She does not ordinarily touch anyone. \"Did you see the heart?\"\n\nIt seems the most natural thing in the world that a garden should have a heart. \"The Vex infest the place,\" he says. \"It gives them something they crave. It… grows them toward what they want to be.\"\n\n\"You didn't answer the question,\" Mara says coolly. It's a perfectly sensible observation. It's the strangest thing Uldren has ever heard her say.\n\n\"Whatever the heart of that place is,\" he says, pacing, \"it's a seed, I think, a seed left behind to grow. Like a… a node of Glimmer. Or…\" The idea strikes him as a thunderbolt. \"Or a tripwire. Bait to attract those who seek out and destroy what they don't understand.\"\n\nBait for Guardians. Bait to mark some milestone in the Traveler's recovery.\n\n\"I told you never to go there,\" Mara says. Her eyes burn. She draws her cloak tight. \"Are you not devoted to me?\"\n\n\"Sister,\" he says, \"of course I am.\"\n\n\"Yet you defy me.\"\n\nYes, Uldren thinks. Yes, aren't those the same thing?

He didn't commend Jolyon to the Queen or throw him a fete for his bravery or even ask if he was sleeping all right after… after everything. He forgot about him.\n\n\"Hey,\" Jolyon says, not looking up. \"You weren't at the range yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't even need a spotter,\" Uldren says, trying to tease him. But it comes off flat and dismissive. \"I've been, uh.\" Dreaming. Recording his dreams. Poring feverishly through the Origin Libraries, searching for confirmation of what his heart wants so desperately to be true. The future of the Awoken could lie in that Garden. There is a wellspring of Light on Earth, a blinding beacon that will only grow brighter. The Awoken will not survive, not as they are; Mara's vision and the truth of their origins will be lost, diluted by the anodyne philosophy of those Cityborn ideologues. The Guardians will kill everything they find.\n\nWhat if the Garden is the Traveler's antithesis?

Revulsion and fear, yes, natural responses, but he must see past them. \"Yes, we've got to record all our observations before they fade.

The profound truth of it hits him like a cold wind. \"You don't, do you?\" Jolyon knows exactly where he was born, to what lineage. His capabilities as a marksman are public record. As one of Uldren's Crows, he flies dangerous surveillance missions, but he is not a covert operative. Uldren knows… everything about him.\n\n\"You gonna be on the range tomorrow?\" Jolyon asks, too casually. \"Thought we might shoot a few magazines.\"\n\n\"Not tomorrow,\" Uldren says. \"I have work to do.\" He is already trying to imagine how Mara would react if he tries to turn the Oracle Engine on the Garden.

Shattered asteroids and cracked habitats spill bright flakes of debris. There is nothing quite so stark and brilliant as sunlit wreckage in vacuum. The Reef is huge, huge, but dense too, its structures and people gathered in tight clusters against the vastness of space. Oryx and the Red Legion ripped great holes in the Reef.

Or maybe she'd just dropped a Guardian and was running full-throttle from a fireteam set on revenge—a common theme this far out. Or was it pride? Did a Captain or a Kell or an Archon challenge her ability to ride? Did Fikrul? After all, their relationship is… complicated.\n\nNone of that matters. Not to me. Each version of the start is as interesting as the next. But the run itself? Her ride through the gnashing jaws of death?\n\nMost Guardians who have heard it dismiss it.

Instead, he found kin in the form of seven scorned. With them, he found purpose and power. As their legend grew, he found believers and new truth. His banishment was not penance, it was reward—for his convictions, for his courage.\n\nFikrul, the crazed fanatic. Fikrul, the heretic Archon who spoke against the very faith he once held dear. Scorned and forgotten—but only for so long.\n\nFikrul was a Dreg.\n\nBefore his banishment—before his clarity of purpose—Fikrul was a celebrated leader of Fallen faith and a savior to those who embraced his teaching.\n\nArchons had long been elevated in Fallen society, but their stature grew, and their role shifted following the Whirlwind. As desperation took hold and the last of the Fallen raced across the stars in search of salvation, their dependence on machines evolved into a deep-rooted need—their weapons to fight, their ships to fly, their Servitors to survive.\n\nThat need became worship. That worship became faith. And the Archons—those who oversaw the care and consecration of the Servitors—were looked upon to provide hope through their words, teachings, and interpretations of the machines' wants, needs… desires.\n\nBut Fikrul saw another path—one that would later be mimicked and twisted by the techno-deviant Splicers in the Plaguelands of Earth while he and his explored their own darker interpretations of faith.\n\nFikrul is a Fanatic.\n\nScorned and abandoned.\n\nFikrul is all who strive to regain strength of self and purpose. He is a survivor. He is the outcast priest of the broken plains, and his sermon is death and all the glory that follows.\n\nIn Fikrul's eyes, and those of the outcasts who rallied to his philosophies, machines were not superior. They were not gods. They were tools. Instruments to be mastered and controlled and manipulated in service of Eliksni pride. None should grovel for Ether. None should have their honor bound to the whims of manufactured deities.\n\nBut the evolution of Fikrul's faith did not end there. If the machines—the very things that had regulated the whole of their existence—were tools, why not life itself? Why not death?\n\nThere are many tales of the time between Fikrul's fall and his rise again as spiritual leader of the Scorned Barons—his struggle to find strength as a battered Dreg, his journeys across the system to challenge his faith, his joining with the other outcasts who were scorned, and his eventual union with his \"father.\" The only thing that matters, however, when confronting the dangers of Fikrul is this: He is a creature of faith.\n\nHis faith is the antithesis of all who stand in the Light. That faith has raised an army. That army will baptize all who challenge its purpose in an unending sea of death. They will never stop. They will never give in.

And Reksis, the Hangman, who slaughtered them at every turn. Two allies driven by opposing forces—one science and the unmaking of faith, the other rage and its relentless push to destroy.\n\nThere had long been tension between the two, as Reksis had, more than once, slipped into the Machinist's workshop to inflict himself on the Servitors caged there.\n\nFikrul, the Fanatic—their spiritual leader and one-time Archon Priest—watched patiently as their rivalry grew. He saw strength in their ire. He saw fire and fury, but also more—a new path forward. One that could join their passions and drive them further—a whole stronger than its warring parts.\n\nFikrul waited, biding time as tensions rose and threatened to splinter the Barons' loyalties. Only when Elykris could take no more, on a night when she caught the Hangman prepared to slaughter her latest haul of lesser Servitors, did Fikrul step in.\n\nFikrul motioned to Elykris and said, \"Bring me a Servitor.\" As Reksis hissed with anticipation, she hesitated, but Fikrul was patient. \"Where is your trust?\"\n\nElykris released a Servitor from its bondage.\n\nFikrul motioned the Servitor closer, then turned to Elykris. \"You have gathered many, Machinist. Hundreds. Maybe more. Our own supply—our life force fed by slaved mechanics.\" Elykris nodded to the Servitor as it inched closer to the Archon's open arms—welcoming the once revered orb as one would a child.\n\nThe other Barons began to bark, a rhythmic warriors' chant.\n\n\"For all the value in your work… it is not enough to feed ourselves.\" Fikrul hugged the Servitor. There was a tenderness to the embrace.

Ether hissed and sprayed.\n\nFikrul released the machine's silent shell, and it clanged lifeless to the ground. He turned to Elykris. \"Do you see?\" Elykris smiled. She was ever the brightest among them, though her focus could lose clarity when she became frenzied.\n\nThe Barons had long been trouble for the Awoken and Fallen of the Reef, but that trouble had been limited to hit-and-run tactics. What Fikrul had just presented was a new way.\n\nFikrul stepped to Reksis. \"Do you see?\" The brute barked in response, \"Kill them all!\"\n\nFikrul laughed. \"Not 'all,' Hangman.

The Fallen Houses put out bounties. Lotta Glimmer on our heads. Lotta Ether. Taniks took the gig. Only we didn't know. There'd been stories of a renegade Fallen dropping bodies, but nothing ever concrete, so we just brushed them off as more of the same. Nothing we couldn't handle, even on an off day.\n\nI mean, we were all aware the Fallen were dangerous—big-time threat, each day, every day.

Bad attitude.\n\nSecond… He was standin' over the body of Nian Ruo. Didn't know her well, but we'd done a few runs. That day was supposed to be an in-and-out'er. But then… Taniks.\n\nNian never got back up, and Shiro's boy Lush lost his Ghost—full-on RTL, returned to Light. Gone and done.\n\nThe whole scene was a blur. Lost our haul and hauled our butts outta there. Still not sure how we lost Taniks and his boys. Just lucky we did.\n\n'Course, ditchin' that troublemaker wasn't the end.\n\nShiro and I got back, filled Andal in on the what-went-down soon as we found him. This was before his Vanguard days. He'd been running a second grab on a cache out west. Wasn't back till the next night.\n\nWe told him about Nian. Lush was freaking out about his Ghost. Couldn't blame him.

But I'm not sure.\n\nI do have flashes of memory of the life I had before I was a Guardian, but that's all they are, flashes—quick flickers of people and places in my dreams or in that space between a bullet and getting rezzed.\n\nI see a woman there, and she's all I've ever known of a life long since gone.

Some would say, \"A good man who lies to himself is good only because he hides from the truth.\" But I disagree. I think, in this world, you need to find what is best in you and cling to it.

Because she spoke well, it was agreed that aid would be traded for intelligence and a long-term alliance. In this way, the Awoken were the first to know of the Great Navigator: his philosophies, his strategies, his weaknesses. And as the coven contemplated the possibilities laid wide before this god-king's far-flung sword, it was decreed that they would build a throne world beneath an energy well as blind as the ferryman Charon.\n\nNascia drew the schematics. Portia worked out the calculations. They made their first test with a small rift generator on the eastern shore. Satisfied that their methods were sound, they then went to a grand cathedral to dig the well. There, Lissyl and Sedia augured the first borehole with the help of Riven, who had taken the shape of a needle-nosed basilisk, while Kalli and Shuro Chi constructed the gate itself, deep below, in a hall they named \"The Confluence.\"\n\nIllyn made tincture after tincture of queensfoil until her clothes stank and her hands were stained reddish-black. Open-eyed, she walked between planes and sorted the threads of reality on a vast metaphysical loom, weaving some closer, some more distant.\n\nMara and Riven shaped her third throne together, and the artistry of their work was a testament to the hungry joy they felt in that partnership. They named it Eleusinia, and it was in those Ascendant halls that Mara finally carved a statue for Sjur.\n\nWhen it came time to connect the Well to the unreality that lay beyond the gateway, Sedia asked, \"Would it not be wiser to leave this door without a key?\" Riven, now an immense antlered serpent with broad tiger paws, tightened around the perimeter of the room like a noose.\n\n\"Egg,\" Mara corrected absently, chewing on her thumbnail.\n\n\"The key is so heavy as to be unliftable,\" Kalli ventured, since they were speaking metaphorically.\n\nSedia flapped her hand dismissively. \"Yes, yes, I know.\" They all knew that the gate required a continuous multi-week charge of paracausal energies, and that almost nothing in this solar system could produce such energies at the scale required by the gateway. Almost. \"It's just— do we…\"\n\n\"Do we wish to trust the Guardians?\" Illyn filled in dryly.\n\nMara ran her hand along the sleek surface of the primary well's control mechanism, then turned and walked alone toward the fresh, foggy air that blew in from the coast.

Who are you?\"\n\nThe answer came at once, ++WRONG! IT IS THE EKPYROSIC. WE ARE THE NOTHING-SPACE FABRIC.++\n\nHearing this, Mara recognized a riddle.

Her eyes saw nothing. The other Techeuns were transfixed thusly in a geometric array around the Dreaming City—each one inert, suspended, bleeding.\n\nMastering her horror, Mara said, \"I have lived alongside you.\" And because she was afraid for Kelda, she asked, \"Do you intend violence?\"\n\nAt once, the Techeuns collapsed to the ground like marionettes from severed strings—all but Kelda Wadj, whose augment blazed with coruscating light.

She said, \"Of course.\" Violence, after all, is a matter of perspective. \"What I mean is, what would you ask me?\"\n\nBeloved, wise Kelda Wadj burst apart and then collapsed all at once into a singularity that burned and burned and burned but destroyed nothing around it.

Better that she never had a son than a weakling so easily captured by the enemy.\n\nIt is his bad luck that she catches his foot with one hand. His helmet slams into the rocky cliffside. A piece of his rebreather cracks off and disappears into the mist far below. He flails, but he cannot drag her down with him; somehow, she hauls him in like a fish.

It speaks!\n\nSlowly, without breaking eye contact, she lays her other knife on the ground between them. The blade points toward her boots. He watches her every movement. How many secrets have the flesh-lovers betrayed, that this creature can make peace like a cringing drekh before his kel?\n\nShe taps two fingers against her cuirass. \"Sjur,\" she says slowly, then she points at him.\n\nHonor-bound even as he simmers in scandal, he replies, \"Misraaks.

Esila cast forth her hand and beckoned to Azirim in mercy. And Esila said to him, \"Join us and be glad, but let me hear your testimony first.\"\n\nAnd so invited, Azirim bowed his crested head and hid a secret smile and spoke with the pardon Esila had given him. He recounted his many regrets in deceiving the kind merchants in the capital city of Interamnia. He recounted his charity to the wayfaring Corsairs who could not have escaped the heliopause without his aid. He recounted his journey to retrieve the eutech stolen from Pallas by the profane scavengers the Fallen, and he named his friends and those who had shown him kindness. And from the raucous parties beyond the lush gardens of Esila came an audience of Techeuns in training and flush-cheeked young Corsairs. They knelt in the dewy grass and they listened, and as they listened, and as Azirim spoke, his appetite grew and grew. Night fell on the Dreaming City.\n\nAnd Azirim said to those who knelt enraptured, \"Come, let me sing to you of extinction. Let me sing to you of lives lost in beautiful places, o audience mine. Sing with me, sing!\" He bade them rise, and led them singing down and away from the gardens of Esila. He spread his wings and flew out into the empty air beyond the steep cliffs that bordered the gardens.

She doesn't know whether she will fly away or drop dead. As the elevator descends, she looks left at Illyn and then right at Uldren. She shuffles in her gleaming formal armor. From exile as Tower emissary to THIS is incredible. Unbelievable. She does not deserve it. \"This is real,\" she whispers, unable to stop herself. Uldren smiles, but Illyn makes a warding gesture: Be silent!\n\nMusic begins to swell as the elevator settles. At the center of the room, the Paladins and the rest of Illyn's Techeuns are arrayed around Riven, of course, and—\n\nHer breath catches. \n\nMara. \n\nShe can't help shooting another quick glance at Uldren: How..?\n\nHis smile widens.\n\nPetra sets her jaw, pulls her shoulders back, stands strong and tall.\n\nA chorus of thirty sings them into the Hall of Names. The air is sweet with lavender, and there are hundreds of candles lit all around the room, and even at this distance she can see Hallam is verklempt. This is as good a homecoming as she could ever imagine. More than she ever deserved.\n\nWhen they reach the dais, she kneels. Uldren and Illyn proceed past her so that they can acknowledge the Queen and her waiting counselors. The song ends; the music quells. Uldren and Illyn speak together, and their voices ring out fierce and true. \"Your Grace, we here present to you Petra Venj, your loyal servant, wherefore all you who are come this day to witness her homage and service. Do you acknowledge her?\"\n\nPetra cannot see anything but her own distorted reflection in her polished sabatons. She closes her eyes.\n\n\"I do,\" Mara says, and Petra's throat tightens.\n\nUldren and Illyn turn, synchronized. \"Petra Venj! Are you willing to take the oath?\"\n\n\"I am willing,\" Petra manages, struggling to steady her voice.\n\n\"Will you solemnly promise and swear to protect our people, our holdings, our territories, and our immaterial interests?\"\n\n\"I solemnly promise so to do.\"\n\n\"Will you to your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Will you, to the utmost of your power, uphold your sospital duties in defense of your Queen's life?

And will you preserve unto your dying breath the secrets committed to your charge?\"\n\n\"All this I promise to do.\"\n\n\"Then rise,\" Mara says, \"and declare yourself.\"\n\nPetra lifts her head to find Mara's eyes. \"Let it be declared that the oaths which I have here before promised, I, Petra Venj, will perform and keep.\"\n\nMara smiles and steps forward with a fresh-forged knife. \"Then receive this blade, brought now from the forges of Interamnia. With this blade, do justice, stop the growth of inequity, restore the things that are gone to decay, maintain the things that are restored, punish and reform the things that are amiss, and confirm the things that are in proper order: that doing these things you may embody my will and become my Wrath. May the hunt be good.\"\n\n\"May the hunt be good,\" echoes the assembly.\n\nPetra does not see the cynical glance that passes between Leona and Pavel, who have both served the Queen faithfully for decades.

She wets the pad of her thumb with the tip of her tongue, then uses the moisture to hold a bundle of fresh-picked asphodelia in place. She ties off the stems with a length of silk-spun gold thread, then begins the mindless busywork of braiding in all the expected accoutrements: a serrated fang, a shotgun shell, a cloudy amethyst crystal…\n\nRiven turns to watch. On this day, her head is the size of a Fallen pike. She is vibrant blue with a yellow and red crest, and her pupils are crescents within her lidless eyes. After a time, she says, \"Madadh is dead but you make him no bouquet.\" \n\nMara looks up, struck by the novelty of the moment. She studies Riven, and swallows the first words that come to her tongue, which are, Madadh's bones are whispering at this very moment on Venus. Instead, she asks, \"You mourn him?\"\n\nThat crescent-pupil contracts as thin as a sickle's edge. \"No.\"\n\nHaving found the true answer, Mara resumes her work. A while passes in silence until she says, \"Ahamkara have no traditions.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No sentiment.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMara bites off a piece of thread. \"Why did you allow my brother to spirit you away?\"\n\n\"You know this truth, wise Queen.

When she finishes her memorial bouquet, she unfolds herself and rises to stretch. Riven does the same, and as she relaxes, she spreads and shuffles and shakes her pinions until they all lie straight.\n\nThe land around them is shapeless rock that will become an aubade to those left behind; Mara will honor her enemies and friends alike in stone, she will build grand cathedrals veneered in amethyst and agate.\n\nRiven butts her rounded snout under Mara's hand and waits.\n\n\"Let us find Kelda,\" Mara says.","name":"Riven","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/57c8e5b0eaf344ca17453c2963e4ede2.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2176242266,"index":503,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2176242267":{"displayProperties":{"description":"SHE HAS RUINED EVERYTHING!\n\nSuch blind arrogance—\n\nWE ARE LOST!\n\nh u r r y\n\nHe will recruit them all if we do not act now\n\nW H A T C A N W E D O\n\nDone cannot be undone!

He had killed it twice in ambush, he said, to be certain it could not die. It had once been an Awoken man, and, recognizing it, Mara turned away from her plans for the Dreaming City and watched it coolly.\n\n\"It is a Guardian,\" she said. \"Once it was Chao Mu.\" He had left the Reef alone, knowing that he could never return or see his family again, to repair a failing climate controller in what had once been Earth's Gobi breadbasket. He had said he could not bear to watch the world wither.\n\n\"Bow before the Queen,\" Uldren said, giving him a shove.\n\nThe Awoken man looked at him, then back at Mara. \"Your Majesty,\" he said, bowing. \"My name is Savin.\"\n\n\"You do not remember your wives?\"\n\nHe did not.\n\n\"You do not remember your child, who is now a hundred and ten?\"\n\nHe did not.\n\n\"You do not remember your passion, which was the insulation of minutely sensitive detectors from all but the most specific and subtle radiations?\"\n\nHe did not, except that he said he could touch magnetic fields and loved to tweak the miniscule weave of the circuits in his robe. He had a zoogoer's enthusiasm for particle physics.\n\n\"To what do you owe your loyalty?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu said, \"my Ghost told me that I am a Guardian of the Traveler, reborn in its Light. I was not a day old when your brother waylaid me.\"\n\nAnd he caused to appear from his body a machine like a sphere cradled in a broken cube, which bobbed impertinently and blinked at the Queen. \"You'll make an enemy of the City and every Guardian in it if you keep us against our will,\" the machine warned them. \"But we would gladly be your allies, if you desire it. The City has no idea of your existence, except faint myths among the Awoken on Earth.\"\n\n\"Does it speak for you?\" the Queen challenged Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu.\n\n\"I speak for myself,\" Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu answered. \"Behold!\" And he drew forth from the quantum vacuum a shrieking singularity, which he held between his hands and then telescoped down into nothing.\n\n\"Are you intrinsically good?\" the Queen asked.\n\n\"I hope so,\" he answered. The Queen knew this was a lie or a misapprehension. She was aware of the Risen and the cruel fiefdoms they had sometimes enabled. However, perhaps the Ghosts that had made the Risen were destroyed or became enlightened.\n\nNow the Queen asked the Techeuns to assess the differences between the Chao Mu they remembered and this Savin returned as a Guardian of the Traveler, using their most sensitive physical and psychological tests. Most of all, though, the Queen was curious about the reaction of her Ahamkara, which had begun to salivate, and to assume a form more like the Guardian expected: monstrous and befanged.\n\nBut her brother whispered urgently to her, \"We must know how to kill it, Mara. There are more every day.\" \n\nSavin the Guardian showed a tremendous fondness for doing things; he had a pathologically task-oriented nature, which made him very useful to the Reef. Yet there was always the sense that his Ghost was watching, observing, reporting. And Savin was most of all greedy—not in the grasping manner of the petty, but in an enormous, all-consuming way, for he desired materials and experiences that would temper him into a better Guardian, and he was always experimenting with his strange powers in foolish ways that left him briefly dead, seeking \"a new Super ability\" or \"some way to make my grenades faster.\" He grew tired of performing trivial tasks about the Reef, complaining that the dangerous repairs he made were endless and boring, and that he wanted to move on to new worlds. He leapt into space, repeatedly and without reason, as if his death were no more traumatic than a hop off a curb. Obsessed with reward and efficiency, he would rather do one profitable thing a thousand times than waste his efforts on a less beneficial novelty.\n\nBy the end of her acquaintance with Savin, Mara had decided she did not like this Traveler and what it did to people. Yet she had also decided that she felt a strange kinship and sympathy for it, this cornered, desperate god, making infinite sacrifices out of its people.\n\nPerhaps the Earth would be better off if the Traveler vanished or was destroyed, she thought. Even in the Reef, she felt as if she were living next to a torch held up in a dark wilderness, calling out across the galaxy to hungry things with too many eyes.","name":"Savin","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/57c8e5b0eaf344ca17453c2963e4ede2.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2193019845,"index":505,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"412159069":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Secrets.

She looks down and kicks her legs.\n\nThe stars shine brilliant here, because the sun is only fractionally brighter than the rest of them. Sol lies almost perfectly below her. Of course up and down are defined only by the thrust axis of Yang Liwei. Upward, the black umbrella of the shield and the matter storage, and the docked ships which make Yang Liwei not just a mothership, but an entire traveling fleet. Down below, along the slim spine of the ship, the shielded bulb of the engine glows invisibly infrared. If she slips off this ledge, she will fall down the ship's length at one-third of an Earth gravity, not because there is anything pulling her, but because the ship is pulling away.\n\nYang Liwei is accelerating, slowly but inexorably, toward the stars.\n\nShe is of no single race or ancestry, and the light on her skin is the color of starlight: She drifts with her suit tinted clear so she can soak it up. She was nineteen years and nine months old at the moment the ship began its transtellar injection burn, although this is true only if you count by the calendar of a planet she has barely visited but will always love. She thinks you cannot help but love Earth if you grow up in space. You love Earth the way all adolescents secretly adore two-century-old video of nai nai and ye ye dancing on New Year's Eve. Earth does not ask too much. The colonies are demanding parents, but Earth is like a chill old grandam, simmering in weird art and weirder ideas, enthroned upon ecology older than Human time. Earth was the first terraformed world. Life made Earth livable.\n\nShe is going with Yang Liwei and the rest of Project Amrita to make new worlds.\n\nShe came because she saw an omen in a man's death. She was on EVA with him, repairing a jammed radiator fin on an uncrewed circum-Jovian platform. They worked in companionable silence, listening to the howl of the Jovian magnetosphere when it happened. A frozen rabbit embryo came out of deep space at forty kilometers per second and went through his faceplate. The rabbit must have been spilled in a biocontainer accident far from the sun to plunge back inward like a comet.\n\nImmediately afterward—for reasons very clear to her because she has always had a sense for the meaning of things, reasons very difficult to explain to others because she has always felt this sense was secret—she asked her mother if the family could travel with Project Amrita.\n\nAmrita: the drink that endeth drinking, the bottomless cup. It is the quest to spread far beyond the solar system and to end Human dependence on the Traveler. It calls to those who see Humanity as a cocoon, an instar, a form ready to be shed.\n\nShe is an Auturge 3rd Class, a self-motivating subsystem of the ship's inclusive ecology, a term that spans technology, biology, and behavior, all of which must be maintained for the mission to succeed. Her task is to locate problems and report them to an Auturge 2nd Class, who will give her the tools she needs to repair them. But she never speaks to her 2nd. She never tells anyone about the problems she finds. Instead she fixes them herself. Her work has therefore assumed a magical quality: She appears where there is trouble, and shortly afterward, the trouble goes away. People have begun to leave gifts for her. Some of these gifts are questions. She answers the questions with a quiet confidence some would argue she has not earned. She knows she sees more of their lives than they see of hers—and that this mystery, this seeing-without-being-seen, grants her a kind of power that is like wisdom.\n\nShe lives outside the ship, suited and cocooned in a layer of cytogel, which keeps her surgically clean. She misses the wild zero-gravity fashions of her upbringing, clothes like drifting jellyfish that squirm away from snags, self-correcting darts in the fabric, silk like cool spilled alcohol. She misses the sense of oil and sweat on her skin, for the suit leaves her so clean that she feels skinned raw.\n\nStill, she stays out here because she wants to feel the changing taste of starlight as the universe ahead blue-shifts. As Yang Liwei accelerates toward lightspeed, it moves faster and faster into the light coming from ahead. If light were like dust, it would strike Yang faster, but light can never change speed, so it gains energy instead. Red light is low energy, and blue-violet light is high energy, so the universe becomes blue.\n\nEven now, the very tip of the visual spectrum, violet-blue light, is shifting up into invisible ultraviolet, the color of speed, the color of future.","name":"Brephos I","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":412159070,"index":507,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"412159071":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"Mara!\" the fighter shouts, delighted, and a punch shuts him concussively up. It's a real good hit, a thunderous uppercut to the point of the jaw. Mara hears his teeth grind across each other, down into lip-flesh and shredded gums. She cringes in silent sympathy. He loses his grip on the equipment rack and tumbles out into zero gravity in a big arc of blood. His opponent goes for the coup de gras, kicks off hard and catches him in the stomach like a Human torpedo. They plunge together toward the killzone painted on the floor.\n\nUldwyn grins messily at Mara over his opponent's shoulder. He's fighting a big, brutal woman from Gravity Ops, a woman who's had her myostatin genes knocked out so she can swell up into a giant plug of brawn. Uldwyn doesn't have a chance. He took the fight for the same reason he wanted to join the Amrita expedition—he measures himself by the bravery of his losses. By what he can survive losing.\n\nHe applies a blood choke. It's the right move, but it doesn't matter. The woman groans, grays out, goes limp—but Uldwyn can't get out from beneath her sheer inertia before he hits the killzone. The bell goes off. Uldwyn groans as his rail-hard body forcibly decelerates his opponent's entire mass. Events have built up momentum, and he is just in the way.\n\n\"What did you lose?\" Mara asks him.\n\nHe lies there panting and grinning, shedding perfectly round spheres of blood. \"It's good to see you inside. What brought you?\"\n\nShe and her fraternal twin never answer each other's questions directly. Mara is cool with this because she feels like words are a very bad system of encryption, and that if you really want to communicate with someone, you must develop your own special one-to-one cryptosystem. The ideal statement, Mara feels, would be indecipherable to anyone but the person it's spoken to—and even then, only if they know you are the one speaking.\n\n\"I got you some pictures,\" she says, pushing the big woman off him, eliciting a fuzzy \"oh hi Mara.\" \"Full sensorium captures. You can trade them for the parts I need.\"\n\nUldwyn helps the big woman pull herself vertical, but his eyes are narrow on Mara. Not because he's sore at the idea of helping her—he's always liked bartering, bargaining, the hustle—but because he knows what kind of black market wants these captures. \"How far off the hull did you take them?\"\n\nHow far off? All the way off. They are in zero gravity because Yang Liwei shut off its engines for an inspection cycle. So while Uldwyn got in prize fights, Mara kicked off Yang Liwei's forward shield and coasted ten kilometers into pure void, tethered by only a thread-thin molecular line. She ordered her suit's cytogel to gather around her face. Then, only then, she overrode every sanity system in her softsuit and commanded it to retract into storage mode.\n\nThe suit peeled away like rind and she was drifting in hard vacuum.\n\nThe void boiled the water off her skin. Her body swelled with unchecked pressure until her undersuit forced it to stop. Alarmed cytogel crawled down her throat, hissing emergency oxygen: not enough. Her skin blued with cyanosis. She was bathed in the most profound emptiness.\n\nShe recorded all of it at the neural level. The exquisite darkness. The sense of fatal independence from all things. There are those who will give anything to feel that void.\n\n\"You can't keep doing this,\" Uldwyn complains, as the big woman stares at Mara in awe. \"Mom is going to die of worry.\"","name":"Brephos II","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":412159071,"index":508,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"412159064":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"I really don't care what risks you take,\" Mara's mother sighs. \"That's the deal we made, my little yellow star—\"\n\n\"Mom!\" Mara protests.\n\n\"My discarded tube of sealant, my sweet little fleck of paint—\"\n\nOsana likes to compare Mara to small pestilent items that drift near spacecraft, like crystals of frozen urine. As far as Mara can tell, Osana is the apex of a centuries-long project to create the ultimate embarrassing mom. She is also very blunt: \"Mara, even when you were little, you wanted me to treat you like an adult. So I have. But you remember what I told you, don't you? If you don't want to be my daughter, I can't watch over you like a mother would. I can't put you first, like a mother would. I will always be your friend, but I have to make my own choices too.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean you had to tell the Captain!\"\n\nThey walk shoulder-to-shoulder down the companionway to Captain Li's wardroom. Mara keeps trying to get a step ahead, to lead, but Osana somehow matches her every time. \"Of course I did,\" Osana says. \"You started a cult, Mara. If I didn't say something to the Captain, Behavior would've had this conversation with you instead. Do you want that?\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything. People liked my captures. People left me presents, spare parts, tips—then Uldwyn got into it, you know how he is—\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Osana wheels on her. \"For shame, Mara. You know your brother will follow anywhere you lead. You know he's not capable of the same, ah,\" her lips twitch, \"imperial remove. You knew he'd brag about you living on the hull—and you let him do it. It is one thing to have a particular power over people, Mara. But it is another to deny that you are using it.\"\n\nMara thinks she can come up with a stinging retort, given a few more paces, but it's too late. The hatch to Captain Li's wardroom swings open. Mara is terrified of this place. This is where Captain Alice Li, divine presence in Mara's life, interfaces with the officers who are the manifestations of her will. Since Mara wants to be Alice Li someday, the wardroom makes Mara feel like she is an usurper princess scoping out her rival's court.\n\nCaptain Li offers them tea. Mara cannot imagine the ways in which she is butchering what must be an intricate and meaningful tea ceremony. Li serves some very battered pre-Traveler ceramic sloshing with hot green tea, then immediately adulterates her own cup with milk from the Cow Thing on the biodeck.\n\n\"Revolting, isn't it?\" She smiles at Mara's bewildered horror. \"You should've seen what I put in my tea when I was camping in Mongolia. I understand your colleague, who is also your mother, has some concerns about your relationship with the rest of the crew?\"\n\n\"My darling Mara,\" Osana says, \"has—entirely by accident, I'm sure—cultivated a reputation as a minor divinity. Her captures from outside the ship are hot items for barter. People draw fan art. There are… tips left for her.\"\n\n\"You take captures while EVA, sometimes without a suit?\" Li nods. \"Yes, I've played one. A remarkable sensation.\" This makes Mara grin impetuously. \"Mara, you are an Auturge, a volunteer. I cannot order you to stop, and your work is exemplary. Are you putting anyone else in danger with your… art projects?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"Just myself.\"\n\n\"False!\" Li barks. \"That is a selfish answer. You are now a symbol to my crew, a house god. If you were to die, they would lose something important, something Human that they have created out of loneliness and void. It would be an unforgettable reminder of the hostile nothingness that surrounds us. When you endanger yourself, you endanger that symbol. You are part of this mission's behavioral armor, Mara.\"\n\nMara is thunderstruck. She's never thought about it this way. \"All I did was take some captures. I didn't ask to be anyone's… mascot.\"\n\n\"You presented yourself as a conduit to secret knowledge,\" Captain Li counters. \"People made something out of you, Mara. Please take this from a starship captain: What people make of you, what they create of you—even without your consent—becomes a kind of responsibility. If the Mara they see when they look at you is good for them, then you have some duty to be that Mara.\" She looks to Osana. \"What about your boy? He's in medical more often than any of the other underground fighters.\"\n\nIt does not surprise Mara that Captain Li knows about the fights. \"My son,\" Osana says, \"is determined to be his own worst enemy.

A rumble and a thrum down in her gut, in her marrow, in the lowest, basest elements of her body. It is the vibration, the sound of the very fabric of her being scrunching up and stretching out; the distance between the atoms of her body collapses, then expands. The cycle repeats again and again. For a moment, she feels her fingertips and toes pulled away from her core, yanked by tidal forces. It feels like the lowest rumble of the biggest subwoofer ever built. It sounds like the deep voice of God whispering ASMR directly into her ear. It tingles, it thrills, and it leaves in its wake a subsonic tint of dread and anticipation.\n\nShe shivers. \"Gravity wave,\" she says. \"Talk to me, Geode.\"\n\nThe Space-Time Geodesics Officer looks like she's just been hand-delivered a Nobel. \"This is amazing!\" she crows, fully aware that she and everyone else are about to die, but transported away from such temporal concerns by scientific rapture. \"Can you feel that growl? We're experiencing high-frequency, high-amplitude gravity waves. Phaeton strikes. Axions decaying through the hull. Sterile neutrinos. It's all coming from a source at bearing, uh, zero four five mark zero three zero relative, range—range highly variable.\"\n\nAnother wave tears through Yang Liwei. Everything in the ship simultaneously compresses and stretches as the gravity wave deforms the space-time metric. \"Is it the phantom?\" Li demands, as her ship thrums subsonically. \"Is that phantom ship emitting these waves?\"\n\n\"I have no idea!\" GEOD says, exultantly. \"None of this makes any sense at all! Wow!\"\n\nAlice Li has the distinct sense that something ancient and malevolent is operating upon them: a trillion-fingered hand reaching in to caress the very atoms of their being, setting protons a-spin, strumming nerves like guitar strings. A tongue with ten billion slithering forks tasting the surface of their brains. The sense of imminent doom crescendos. She knows, absolutely and utterly, that what is about to happen to her and to her crew is far worse than death. The darkness knows them now. The thing that has come to kill Humanity has their taste.\n\n\"INCO.\" She clings to her restraint harness as the ship growls through another wave. Her bones creak as they stretch. \"Last report on the Traveler? Any sign of an intervention?\"\n\n\"It was at Earth, Captain, and there were high-yield weapon discharges all over the signal.

She cannot bear to let anyone see her fear or her awe at the scale of destruction or her pity for the billions of souls dying in darkness back around Sol. She cannot be among the other crew as they cling to each other and whisper reassurances; not even with her mother. She cannot surrender her mystery.\n\nSo she kicks off the hull on fifty kilometers of tether.\n\nBut there's no starlight to die in. The darkness is absolute. Gravity waves tug on her line, pulling her back toward Yang and then hurling her away. In time, she feels another vibration in the line. \"Sister,\" the tether transmits. \"I'm coming out to get you.\"\n\nBrother, she thinks, you'll lose yourself trying to follow me.\n\nCaptain Li's voice breaks through the static, drawn out to a mumble and then compressed to a shriek. Spikes of hard radiation go through her words like bullets, spattering phonemes into eerie compression artifacts. \"This is the interstellar vessel Yang Liwei to the entity interacting with us. We are not involved in your dispute with the powers around this star. We are on a mission to begin a new life elsewhere. Our purpose is orthogonal to yours. We request your indifference…\"\n\nMara's tether trembles with Uldwyn's progress. She holds it in one hand and reaches out with the other, gripping the emptiness, feeling how the tides of broken space pull at her fingertips. She senses that the nothingness around her is not indifferent; that it is aware of all purposes, and that its own purpose encompasses them. It is infinitely hostile because it must be.\n\nSuddenly, as if the void around her has just spontaneously Big Banged, she sees light.\n\nA point of pure white shines in the cosmic distance. Not just visible luminance—her suit decomposes the spectrum—but light in the radio bands, in microwave, keening ultraviolet, a spike of gamma, a total and all-embracing radiation. It sings. It chatters. It speaks in a voice older than suns. She feels that she could Fourier the voice for a century and never decompose it into its parts. It is awesome and appalling and piercingly true. Mara understands how those who die in radiation accidents must feel: A single flash of invisible power sears away all possible futures except one. She feels her soul itself has been ionized, blasted into a higher energy state.\n\nThe light pierces the darkness. Not like the sunrise, not like a wall or a flood, but a single crepuscular ray—a finger of radiance that reaches out through deepest night to touch her. It illuminates Mara, Uldwyn, and Yang Liwei.\n\nIt is not quite enough. It cannot vanquish the shadow.\n\nThus Mara finds herself drifting on the edge of the Light and the Darkness, on the dusk-and-dawn gradient between the two.\n\nShe feels a contest. A battle fought, an equilibrium reached: not a truce, but an infinite limit, like an equation dividing by zero, a collision of two violent eternities. Mara queries Yang Liwei for telemetry and her sensorium fills with the terrified scream of gravitational instruments. She howls too, a feral sound, ecstatic and lost: a wolf baying at the stars. She knows what's happening. Too much power has gathered here. The universe is appalled by the paradox. Nothing that has glimpsed this collision of infinitudes can be allowed to escape. The cosmos must censor its embarrassment. It must sequester the anomaly.\n\nThe slope of warped space-time around them has become too steep, and now every path outward or forward bends back to the center where Light and Dark collide. The definition of \"future\" has become synonymous with the definition of \"inward.\" This is why it's called an event horizon: For an object within the horizon, the path of all future things that can be done or seen leads inevitably down to the center. All events lead inward.\n\nA singularity is forming around her. A kugelblitz: a black hole created by the concentration of raw energy.\n\n\"Mara!\" Uldwyn shouts. \"Mara, you're too far out!\"\n\nMara thinks of her mother's face. She hears Osana say: I can't watch over you like a mother would. I have to make my own choices now.\n\nShe fires the detach command into the tether.\n\nGravity seizes her. She falls forward in space and time, into the future, into the mystery. Yang Liwei is behind her. Uldwyn is behind her.

In this manner, conjured forth by their doubling, the sleepers did awaken. In time the awoken spilled across the face of the world, and their number was forty thousand eight hundred ninety one. They drank of the sweet rain, and they ate of the fruit of the forest, and the starlight pooled as clear oil on their skin. First of their tongues was Speech, and the first of their hunting weapons was the bow.\n\nNow the awoken called out for a name to distinguish World from Unworld. The eight hundred ninety one said to the forty thousand, \"Let this world be named Tributary, for we dream of a great river from which we have parted.\" But the forty thousand were troubled, and they asked to know their antecedent, the place from which they came. \"We did not awaken from the sleep that we entered,\" said the forty thousand. \"In our rest we passed through some terminus and our atavism was severed from us. How did it happen thus?\"\n\nSo a council was called at the place where the rivers met to determine the nature and purpose of existence. Here was undertaken the first census, which counted thirty thousand one hundred eleven women, ten thousand two hundred ninety five men, and four hundred eighty five otherwise. A fear arose among the awoken that the men and otherwise would be lost.\n\nAlis Li spoke first in council, but at the urging of Uldren, many sought out Mara for secret conclave. Among these were Kelda Wadj, who would be the Allteacher, and Sila, who would be mother of Esila.\n\nSayeth Alis, \"We were granted this world by a covenant with high powers, and in that covenant, we yielded our claim to our history. We abandoned what came before, but in doing so, we cast off all our debts. Look forward!

I call for a vote.\"\n\nSayeth Mara, in secret, \"I think that we came here as safe harbor, and we cannot forever remain. I remember the danger was appalling. I remember we were born in death. I think we must gather ourselves carefully until the time is right.\"\n\nFrom this council, there arose eight verdicts and a ninth.\n\nFirst, that the people were Awoken, and they were immortal.\n\nSecond, that this world was Tributary of another, but that it was forbidden to seek any way to rejoin the mother stream. For this reason, it would be called the Distributary, for that was the proper name for a river that branches from the mother and does not return.\n\nThird, that the Awoken should multiply in wombs of flesh and machine, but only after the most careful forecast of population and ecology, and only under the supervision of those who knew the good technology; for each new child would be immortal.\n\nFourth, that those wise in the good technology should be heralded and heeded, so that the eu-technology could be preserved. They would be eutechs.\n\nFifth, that the women should hold care and protection of the men and the others until more could be born.\n\nSixth, that the purpose of the Awoken should be to know and love the cosmos.\n\nSeventh, that the Awoken were created out of covenant with Light and Darkness, but the covenant was complete, and no further debt would ever be called, except the duty of the Second Verdict to remain on the Distributary.\n\nEighth, that the Awoken were whole in themselves, and they existed in balance.\n\nNinth, that there would be no vote, but instead Alis Li would be recognized as Queen.

Hunters and pioneers sought the shape of the world, sailors charted the skein of rivers and the perimeter of seas, and astronomers plotted the motion of the crowded heavens. Over this age ruled Queen Alis Li, whose work was the creation of agriculture and the preservation of the eutechnology that she deciphered from the Shipspire.\n\nBut there remained in the forests many tribes of huntresses who preferred their lightfooted freedom-from-comfort-and-duty to the painstaking surplus of the city. Among these tribes, Mara lived with her brother—whose name had returned as Uldren—and with Osana, their mother. It is said that Osana lived as a negotiator and that her son brought her news from other tribes, for he was a scout and hunter of renown. Mara dwelt alone on a mountaintop.\n\nIn the tribes of the forests and the sea, there was the belief that the Awoken had been made out of a friction between contesting forces and that one day this conflict would need to be resolved. These were the Eccaleists who preached that Awoken owed a debt to the cosmos.\n\nIn the cities, however, they lived by the Seventh Verdict under their Queen, and they said the Awoken had been created by cosmic gift and carried neither responsibility nor eschaton. These were the Sanguine, who preached that the Awoken were as stable as an atom of carbon.\n\nNow there arose among the Eccaleists a woman out of the eight hundred ninety one who called herself the Diasyrm. She went into the cities, calling out, \"I accuse the Queen of deicide!\" When she was questioned, she spoke of a foundational crime.\n\n\"Alis Li was the first to awaken in this world,\" the Diasyrm preached. \"She set the terms of our existence. We could have been gods free of want or suffering. Instead, Alis Li chose our mortal form. Our Queen is complicit in all the pain we experience!

One of the 891 fell today, shot down by a matter laser, a coherent boson weapon: There was almost nothing left to burn. Matter lasers are the kind of appalling maltech weapon Alis thought she'd locked up in the Shipspire's vaults. She'd armed a few of her Paladins with them, just a few—women she couldn't bear to lose…\n\nThe thought that one might have defected to the Diasyrm breaks her heart.\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to go this way,\" Alis repeats. She has not had a confidante in nigh on fifty years: There is no one to whom she can show any doubt. \"I promise you it wasn't.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mara says.

Did you answer her? Is that why she's so convinced I,\" she swallows against the bitter taste of her enemy's words, \"enslaved her in mere Humanity?\"\n\n\"I didn't have to tell her.\" Mara's white hair stirs in the hot wind. A herd of black horses crosses the northern horizon, all born of Shipspire's wombs: chased by a long-legged huntress and her collie. \"You don't keep enough secrets, your Majesty. The Diasyrm might have opened any one of your texts and read the story you tell. \"We were born when a great ship fell into a pearl of shattered space. I awoke first, and in my awakening I collapsed the potential of the void into a form I understood…\" Who can read that truth and not hear arrogance?\"\n\nAlis thought Mara might say that. Alis also thought Mara might try to push her off the balcony, but she now knows that was a petty fear. Mara is not the Diasyrm: Mara knows the unthinkable value of even a single Awoken life.\n\n\"Why do you love lies so much?\" she asks Mara.\n\n\"Not lies.\" The pale radiance of Mara's eyes; the flush of violet stain around them. \"Secrets.

An immortal's grief and murder-guilt, left untended, will never fade. Thus it became known to those who fought in the Theodicy War that they had committed an incomparable evil. However, they could not confront their own responsibility, so they rose up in wrath against those who had given them cause, whether by caging them in flesh bodies or by drawing blood over grievance. The war continued by spear and bow, by knife and scalpel, by old machine and new invention. Ever did the Diasyrm's faithful call for the unawaring of Queen Alis Li.\n\nNow there entered into the Diasyrm's camp Osana, mother of Mara, famed for her skill in negotiating contested land. She had come with her son Uldren, who could win a place in any camp for his beauty and for the regal crow-eagle that alighted on his shoulder.\n\n\"I come from Mara,\" said Osana, \"whose heart has frozen in her chest. If you will end the killing, she will tell you any secret that you desire.\"\n\nFor his part, Uldren went among the Diasyrm's warriors and spread ill tidings of Mara's knowledge, saying, \"Mara remembers how the Queen led us here out of chaos and saved us from the twin blindness of darkness and light. Mara knows what the Queen keeps secret. Mara has seen the strife in our souls, the clash from which we were made. We could not ever have been gods with this flaw in us! Rather, we were made from this schism. For as all life is born from energy gradient, as life in the World Before was born from the gradient between hot proton-rich ventwater and cold seawater, we were born of the shadowline at the edge of Light and Dark. We are tremors in that fault. Forever will that schism lead us.\"\n\nHearing this new heresy, the Eccaleists were seized with rapture and scattered to the points of the compass, telling all they met, \"We are the yield of a mighty engine! We could never have been gods! Like diamonds, we were crushed into being. Like diamonds, we hold flaws.\"\n\nMeanwhile Osana spoke to the Diasyrm, who was also heartsick from the killing, and who longed to withdraw from the world and seek transcendence within. \"There is no weregild for the murder of an immortal,\" Osana counseled her. \"You must become a teacher or a midwife and devote yourself to the enrichment of new lives.\"\n\nBut the Diasyrm craved secret knowledge, and she sought Mara upon the mountaintop. Here, she vanished. If she was ever known again, it was not by the name Diasyrm.\n\nWhen there was peace, Queen Li ruled the Awoken for a time; however, the guilt of the war lay heavy upon her, and after an age of peace and progress, she abdicated to a new Queen.","name":"Fideicide III","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":428936651,"index":519,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"428936650":{"displayProperties":{"description":"A woman lives alone on the forest hills above the Feather Barrens. North of her, in a chaos of ravines and clear but fiercely radioactive streams, the hills surrender to high imperial mountains engaged in brutal seismic warfare, for the Distributary is a young world and has not settled its grudges. To the south are the dry lands where the birds of the forest, especially the parrots, go to die. She lives here because one day she will no longer be immortal, and she wants to observe the dignity of death.\n\nUp these hills comes a man and his mother. The man moves with practiced wariness. But his mother is tired of walking, so she sits down on a giant melon and bellows, \"MARAAA!\"\n\nA fountain of startled birds shoots up into the dawnlight. Not far away, the woman looks up from the broken body of a juvenile gray parrot and softly says, \"Mom?\"\n\nThat night over the fire, after Mara and Osana talk around the oddness of long separation, Mara, tending the pheasants on their spits, says, \"Brother, your eagle killed a parrot today.\"\n\n\"He had to hunt,\" Uldren says, carefully. \"You won't forbid him his last pleasures, will you?\"\n\n\"You've brought him here to die?\" Mara wants to leap up and hug her brother, out of pity and respect. Many of his raptors have died before this one, but Uldren has always been grief-stricken and furious at the waste. Now he's accepted what must happen; he has given his bird the respect of choosing its own place and time to pass.\n\n\"I have,\" Uldren says, looking away. Her pride and respect make him a little verklempt. \"Mother decided she would come along.\"\n\nA shear force as powerful as tectonics has divided Mara's heart. She wants to sit down with her mother and ask her everything, but she is afraid of Osana's insight. \"What brings you to my little camp, Mother?\"\n\n\"Lies,\" Osana says. \"Lies and secrets. And the girl who didn't want to be my daughter, who doesn't know the difference between them.\"\n\n\"I know the difference between a girl and a daughter,\" Mara says, purposefully misunderstanding. The drip pan sizzles beneath golden meat. Her stomach growls. \"Your daughter picks up your baton at the end of the race, and goes on living the life you've taught her. You wouldn't want that, Mother. Because then I'd be all your fault.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Osana sighs, \"but you know what I meant.\"\n\nUldren looks between the two of them, frowning. \"Mom, what's this?\"\n\n\"It's your sister about to admit she's behind it all. Aren't you, Mara?\"\n\nShe unimpales the pheasants from the spits and neatly licks hot grease off her hands. If she spoke, she might scream in terror. What does that mean, behind it all? Does Osana know?\n\n\"The Eccaleists are her creation,\" her mother tells her brother. \"The Diasyrm was her pawn. She allowed the Theodisy War because she was afraid we'd be too comfortable here—also so Queen Alis would need her help politically. Mara couldn't afford to be the most radical dissident. She had to seem moderate for her beliefs to thrive. Isn't that right, Mara?\"\n\nMara puts a hand into the warm soil to keep herself from slumping in relief. Mother doesn't know it all. \"Shall I carve your portions?\" she asks, holding the fractal knife blade-down.\n\nUldren has that look. He knows Mara never answers his questions directly; by evading Osana's, it's as if she's saying that the question is really Uldren's to ask. \"Looks delicious. But Mother does make me curious. Why have you always lived away from the rest of us, Mara? The mountaintop, I understood. You had a brand new night sky to chart. But why now? Why go into the woods like a… a hermit? A heretic?\"\n\nFor the same reason she lived on the hull. For the same reason she can never allow Uldren to really reach her. There is power in remove and safety from the belittling politics of temporal power, which reveal the mighty as unforgivably ordinary and petty. The Awoken have a Queen because a Queen can be a mystery.\n\n\"I remember the day I was born,\" she says. \"Do you, Brother?\"\n\nHe flinches from her eyes. He remembers Yang Liwei and the tether into darkness. He remembers how gravity stretched them into agonized ribbons of flesh. He remembers the truth not even Alis Li may be allowed to know; Mara sees the agonizing moment, the cyclic revelation, when he thinks of her crime, allows it to pierce him like a spit, and buries it deep again.\n\nOsana takes her portion of pheasant meat and rolls it in the bowl of sweet cooked nuts her daughter has prepared. The stars are coming out over the mountains, and the forest birds sing. \"This place is good,\" she says. \"This world. Whatever you remember of our lives before, Mara… I know they cannot have been this good.\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"But you were both with me. I hope you always will be.\"\n\n\"Always,\" her brother promises.\n\n\"Eat well.\" Mara claps her hands and stands. \"Tomorrow we journey.\"\n\n\"Where?\" her mother asks.\n\n\"I have star charts to share.\" And heresies to tend to.

These were the Gensym Scribes, who traced their origin to Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, but who were in fact descendants of a band of roving storytellers who traveled across the immense salt glades in a hollering convoy of airboats. Here was their praise of the world:\n\nIt is sweet-watered, and there are no poisons upon it. The temper of the climate is even. Great broad-pawed cats stalk the shallow glades, and brilliant blue flamingos promenade upon the flats. The air is thick and warm, suited for flight, and the wind tastes of forest. No dawn has ever been as glorious as the salt glade dawn, and no dusk has ever moved women to weep as deeply as sunset in the Chriseiads. Corsairs sport upon the open seas, and where they waylay freighters rather than each other, they give rumor and assistance to their prey in proportion to the quality of the chase. Beloved are the stories of young lads and lasses who leap across to the corsair ship for a life of adventure! Beloved also are the terraced farms of the Andalayas, mountains so mighty and so dense with radioactives that they subside year by year into the crust. Most beloved are the fissioneers, who vaulted us to power on a world without petrochemicals. May they forgive the many stories of horror we have told in their memory. May they in particular forgive the lurid stories of the molten lead reactor, and the twelve who were impaled to the ceiling by their control rods, and the Core That Stalked.\n\nIt is the Sanguine Truth that we were granted this world by the unconditional mercy of the powers, and that we will never again know fear.\n\nHowever, the Scribes also recorded their frustration with Mara and Uldren, who alone out of the eight hundred ninety one were said to have seen creation from outside. These two wandered the land gathering lore of portents and prophecies, and all the Eccaleists who remained from ancient days whispered that soon the day of reckoning would be known—the day when the Awoken would be called to repay their debt.\n\nNow in the court of one of the Scribes, there appeared a woman of stellar height and furious wrath, armed with a bow that could be strung only if she twined it around her body and used her whole mass to bend it. \"I am Sjur Eido,\" said the woman, \"and I accuse Mara of the ancient murder of my lady the Diasyrm. In my saddle, I have a weapon with only one death remaining. Take me to Mara, and I will deliver it.\"\n\nThe Scribes consulted and said to each other that this foul murder might prevent another Theodicy War. So they gave Sjur Eido all their knowledge to hunt Mara.","name":"Imponent I","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":428936649,"index":521,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"428936648":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Carefully, the people of the Distributary grew in number. Joyously and constantly, they grew in quality. Those who do not die are as malleable and passionate as the young, as tempered and constant as the mature, and as wise and humble as the best of the old.\n\nBut as ever, the Awoken were troubled by death. It was easy to imagine a world older and harsher than the Distributary, a world crowded with competitors where the slow-changing and lushly alive Awoken would be helpless beside austere mayfly-quick breeders who adapted with every swift generation.\n\nWhy had the Awoken been spared mortality? Were they, as the Sanguine preached, rewarded for their bravery and fidelity in a past existence? Or were the Eccaleists right? Could all the gifts of the Distributary, all the milk-bright stars above, all the years of Awoken life, be a form of cowardice? Was there an unfought battle down in the center of the Awoken soul? A duty yet to be discharged?\n\nQueen Nguya Pin restored the monarchy to prominence over the Gensym Scribes. This she accomplished after a fateful visit, upon the day of the summer solstice, by a hooded and masked woman who some whispered was Mara Sov and others, the long-vanished Diasyrm. For nine and ninety years (a rhetorical figure meaning a long time), the Queen had been an authority only in the arts and matters spiritual. However, Queen Nguya Pin declared she was now an avowed Eccaleist and that the Queen would lead the quest to identify whatever debt the Awoken owed the cosmos. It was time to pursue a dream beloved to all Awoken: the conquest of space and the assessment of the true shape and age of their universe.\n\nThe ancient court of the Queen gave the Gensym Scribes a place to lay down their pride and act as equals. Soon the greatest engineers in the world assembled in the Queen's court, and whatever wealth or resources they required flowed freely. Great cataracts of men and women spilled around the palace screaming of ramjets and apoapses deep into the night, then awakening to pots of thick black coffee to mumble about metric tensors and cosmic microwave anisotropy.\n\nInto this feast of ideas came Sjur Eido, searching for the woman who had turned Queen Pin to Eccaleism. Sjur smoldered with an ancient fury, for another thing that the immortal may nurture is everlasting vendetta.\n\nSjur Eido deduced who among the Queen's court must be a disguised Mara Sov. She followed the hooded figure to her laboratory and watched Mara go to work soldering a makeshift bolometer to search for signs of primordial gravity waves. Sjur Eido's fury and grief whetted themselves against Mara's thoughtless grace and ancient beauty, until at last her heart unseamed itself and spilled its hot blood in a shout. \"Mara Sov!\" she cried, throwing down her maltech matter laser between them. \"I cannot live while you live, but I cannot bear to kill you. I challenge you to a duel to the agony. I will fight your most beloved companion to the death and leave you forever maimed or else die in the attempt.\"\n\nMara could not refuse this challenge. She summoned Uldren, and with a ruthlessness she was no longer frightened to wield, she told Uldren that he would stand for her in battle to the death against Sjur Eido.\n\n\"We cannot put it all upon a single fight,\" Uldren said to the ancient vendetta-bearer. \"Too much would be left to chance. Such an old grudge deserves to be tested well. I propose we fight with blade, with rifle, and with fifth-generation air superiority fighters.\"\n\nSjur Eido accepted these terms.","name":"Imponent II","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":428936648,"index":522,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"428936647":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Now it came to pass that Esila, daughter of Sila, recognized the scent of Sjur Eido, for smell lies deepest in memory. Esila spoke to Queen Nguya Pin about the presence of an ancient hero in her court. While Queen Pin pondered how to honor this visitor—and simmered over the insult of Sjur's unannounced presence—a spy brought word of Sjur Eido's intentions to the Gensym Scribes.\n\nThe many Scribes were troubled by this news, for they had given Sjur Eido license to hunt and kill Mara Sov. If Sjur Eido murdered a guest of the Queen under the Scribes' remit, it would mean war and the end of the great Awoken push for space. Historians were called to the court with bouquets of sweet flowers and grant money to speak of Sjur Eido. \"She was one of Queen Alis Li's Paladins, but she was an Eccaleist, who believed that we would one day be called to repay the gift of our awakening.\"\n\n\"Would she defy the Queen's protection and murder a guest of the court?\" the Scribes asked.\n\n\"Oh, absolutely,\" the historians said, laughing. \"She was a terror.\"\n\nThe Scribes began preparations to flee the Queen's court, as they foresaw Sjur Eido's victory would be blamed on them. Sensing uncertainty, many vital contractors and suppliers withdrew from the space program. The Queen denounced the Gensym Scribes as faithless and selfish, and her Eccaleist followers bristled in rage against the Sanguine majority who had scuttled their dream of flight. Household turned against household, sister against brother, wife against wife. The whole world clenched her fists.\n\nMeanwhile, Sjur Eido and Uldren met each other on a net of woven lianas over a pool of heavy water. The light of the Queen's reactors shimmered beneath them as they took their places. Uldren wore a white chestpiece of ceramic armor over a suit of black tasseled silk, and he wielded a long fractal knife whose cutting edge was nearly three times as long as the blade. Sjur Eido fought in the contoured blue-gray pressure armor of a Paladin with the Star of Eight Edicts blazoned on her chest.\n\nBefore they began, Sjur Eido tore away the sheer curtain over the gardener's nook and looked in on Mara Sov. \"Are you afraid?\" she whispered, half in hatred, half in admiration, all in awe. \"Do you sweat? Does your breath come short?\"\n\nMara pressed her hand to Sjur's faceplate and left no stain. She held Sjur's gauntlet to her heart so Sjur could feel her steady pulse and even breath. \"You don't care about him?\" Sjur pressed her. \"It would mean nothing if I maimed him?\"\n\n\"You ask the right questions,\" Mara said, \"but of the wrong sibling.\"\n\nThen Sjur understood that she fought a man who would always express his love through loss and ordeal.\n\nShe bowed to Uldren and drew her knife. Uldren bowed in mocking reply. They fought across the web of lianas in a slow spiral, creeping like spiders, waiting for the motion of the web beneath them to signal an instant of vulnerability. Then the pounce, the clash, the blur of knives: Sjur Eido's straightforward prisonyard jabs against Uldren's whirling deceptive theater. All of knife fighting is in the seizure and surrender of space: Neither would surrender to the close, the clinch, the berserk adrenaline-sick exchange of thrusts that would leave both dead.\n\nUldren began to cut away key lianas to throw Sjur Eido's footing, and Sjur Eido countered by charging him to keep him off balance. At last, they fell together into the coolant pond. The fight was a draw—but it was only the first of three.","name":"Imponent III","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":428936647,"index":523,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"428936646":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Next, the fallen Paladin and the hunter chose long guns and went out into the monsoon jungle to stalk each other. Sjur Eido selected a Tigerspite in 11x90mm with five-round flock guidance and an inertial sump. Uldren chose a silent needle carbine with a conesnail payload. For six weeks, they stalked each other as the political situation grew more dire. He was the better hunter, stealthier in motion and at ease in the wilderness, but Sjur Eido was the better soldier. She had no respect for the systems of the jungle, and she knew how to use that to her advantage. She drove the animals into a frenzy with violence and habitat disruption. Parrots and crows warned each other of Uldren's stealthy hides, and jealous predators forced him off his carefully scouted trails. Sjur Eido caught him with his back against a rift lake and shot him as he tried to cross the lakebed. The wound was not mortal, for the water ruined the terminal ballistics, but she had won the match.\n\n\"Your life is at stake,\" Mara warned her brother. \"Lose this final match, and you will—\"\n\n\"Am I simple?\" he snarled at her. The wound pained him terribly, but he would not risk more than a little analgesic. \"Leave me my work, Sister, or you leave me nothing at all.\"\n\nNow they would meet in air superiority fighters over the Andalayas. Charges under their seats would detonate if either of them left the engagement area. Because of the small combat zone, Sjur Eido chose a nimble Ermine tactical fighter and a payload of all-aspect heatseeking missiles.\n\n\"Where will we receive these aircraft?\" Uldren demanded. \"How can I trust the equipment?\"\n\nSjur Eido told him that one of the Gensym Scribes would provide the aircraft and requested weapons from her personal deterrent stockpile. \"Very well,\" Uldren sniffed. \"And we will have access to all the weapons these airframes can equip?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Sjur said. \"Those we cannot obtain can be replaced by training simulators.\" She was certain Uldren's wound would cripple him.\n\n\"Then I will fly a Dart,\" Uldren said. The ancient interceptor had awful fire control, dismal maneuverability, and primitive weapons.\n\n\"A Dart?\" Sjur jeered. \"Will you fly with its original weapons, too? You think you can beat me with rockets and a gun?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Uldren purred. \"You accept those terms?\" She did.\n\nThe two duelists took to the skies on a bright winter morning. After a fuel check, a telemetry squawk, and a terrain snapshot, they turned in toward each other from a hundred kilometers apart. Sjur Eido descended for the terrain, knowing Uldren's radar could barely separate her from the clutter. Uldren came straight on.\n\nAt eighty kilometers of separation, Uldren called across the radio, \"Fox three. Kill. Engagement over.\" Sjur sneered at the bluff and prepared to climb into a snap attack when the KILLED alert flashed on her Ermine's training panel. She had forgotten that the Dart's intercept loadout, when it had last served seventy years ago, included an unguided air-to-air nuclear rocket. Uldren had simulation-killed her and everything within several klicks.\n\nOn the tarmac, Sjur Eido threw off her helmet and parachute and knelt before Mara Sov. \"My lady,\" she said, \"as I have fought your brother to a tie, I leave my fate in your hands.

The Awoken could have been angels. Instead, they are flesh.\n\n\"That's that.\" Queen Nguya Pin rises from her portable throne, unfolding two heads taller than Mara. \"Choose your replacement. My work is done, and I will stomach no more.\"\n\nMara smiles at her. \"Is a Queen's work ever done?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't insult me,\" Queen Pin clucks. She brushes windblown pollen from her trousers; today's launches have blasted the spring trees with hot wind. \"You used me to do your work, politically and scientifically. You used me to bundle up the Scribes in a neat little scroll for your disposal. I went along with it for the sake of the monarchy, Mara, not because I'm a fool.

I'm very interested to know the answers.\"\n\n\"You've been a wonderful Queen,\" Mara says. \"No one will ever replace you.\" Although she is thinking of Devna Tel, who was never one of the Scribes, and whose coronation would make a wonderful rebuke to the Scribes' remaining ambitions.\n\nSjur Eido meets her by the ship. \"We'll need a new Queen,\" Mara tells her, leaping up the side of the ramp. \"Word on the satellite?\"\n\n\"Still burning for the Lagrange point. What have you done to Nguya?\"\n\n\"Given her too much perspective, I'm afraid.\" Just as this observatory satellite should help the Awoken see things from Mara's point of view. She smiles as she helps her bodyguard up the ramp, Sjur indulgently pretending that she needs Mara's hand. \"Uldren should be on the ground in Kamarina by now. We'll have a go-ahead on that interferometer buyout when he's done.\"\n\nThere are new stars in the sky. Mara put them there. Huge distributed-array telescopes orbit the Distributary's cool sun; gravity wave sensors and cold primordial neutrino detectors spider the crust. Out of shell corporations and seed investments, she has opened her world as an enormous eye and focused it heavenward. Sjur Eido was her smiling public avatar these past decades, while her brother handled enforcement. The days of covert speed chess in the Queen's court are over: Sjur Eido's open endorsement made Mara the face of Eccaleism and armed Mara with blackmail over all the Gensym Scribes still in power.\n\nYet she has never been so lonely or so worried for the future. Mother has told her that she, Mara, uses her power over Uldren too freely; that she must learn to stop, or her mother will no longer be her friend.\n\n\"Mara?\" Sjur says, catching some flickering expression. Knowing Mara well, she immediately changes tack away from comfort. \"What do you think we'll find with the satellite?\"\n\n\"Proof that it's time for us to go,\" Mara says. \"Proof of what I've known since the beginning.\"\n\nSjur frowns in thought.

We did not earn this utopia by covenant with any cosmic power, or by attaining an enlightened moral condition. We are refugees. We fled from an apocalyptic clash between our ancestors' civilization and an invading power.\" She lowers her eyes. \"The signals we have retrieved tell us that our ancestors were on the edge of defeat. Perhaps extinction.\"\n\n\"It is time that we accept our debt. The Distributary is a refuge, not a birthright; a base to rebuild our strength, not a garden to tend.

We must go back to the war we fled and face our enemies there.\"\n\nShe lets them dangle a moment before she drives it home. \"We have also determined that our birthright, our immortality, is tied to the fundamental traits of this universe. Once we leave, we will begin to age again. In time, we will all die.\n\n\"Will you join me, Awoken? Will you answer my call? All I offer you is hardship and death. All I ask is everything you can offer. But you will see an older starlight.

Mara's ship touches down a polite two kilometers from the Pearl Groves, and she looks out across mazes of channel and tidal pond to the compounds of ancient silver-white stone beyond. Two-ton oysters glitter in the shallows, their shells jeweled with mineral inclusions. Seabirds peck and fret along narrow white beaches. Mara lifts up her black formal skirts and begins her long walk into Alis Li's retreat, the sanctuary of former Queens.\n\n\"Mara,\" Uldren whispers, through her throat mic. \"Don't do this. Take Sjur with you, at least.\"\n\nBut she has to do this, or she'll never be able to face herself again.\n\nThe sun batters at her. She hides under a parasol, but heat gathers in the folds of her garment, in the soles of her shoes. When she squints against the glare, she thinks she can see the shining grains of her fleet in orbit: the Hulls, built under eutech supervision to the specifications of radically post-conscious AI that will one day fly between worlds. It is far too late to stop the project now. Far, far too late for second thoughts: exactly twelve point one billion years too late, really. For Mara in particular.\n\nMara kicks the sand and trudges on.\n\nShe's in a foul mood when she reaches the old Queen's house, but the sight of Alis Li sitting on the porch with a battered tea service makes her smile. \"Thank you for seeing me,\" Mara says.\n\n\"Thank you for coming. I was afraid you'd leave the universe without saying goodbye.\" Alis pours her a cup of cool blackberry tea. \"Have a seat. How's Queen Tel?\"\n\n\"She has declined to endorse my expedition,\" Mara admits, tucking her feet beneath her on the wide wooden deck chair. The tea is too sweet, but so blissfully cool. \"I'm sure you understand her reasons.\"\n\n\"You mean she's declined to endorse the sudden violent severance of tens of thousands of threads from the tapestry of our society? How surprising.\" Alis looks Mara over, critically, then sits back to sigh. \"A Scribe once told me that the definition of a utopia is a place where every single person's happiness is necessary to everyone else. You're going to make a lot of unhappy people, Mara. You'll make the lives of everyone in the world tangibly worse. Not just those you've lured to certain death, but those who will grieve their departure, and all those who will come to grief for lack of labor and knowledge you took with you.\"\n\n\"My people volunteered.\"\n\n\"Your mother told you,\" Alis says, \"that it is one thing for you to have a particular power over people, but another thing entirely to deny that you are using it.\"\n\n\"You once told me,\" Mara counters, \"that I had to consider the symbol people made out of me, and that if it were good, then I had to be that symbol for them. I had to perform as they required. I have done so. I have been the best thing I can think to be.\"\n\n\"Is this the best thing you could think to be?\" Alis says, with very practiced neutrality.\n\nMara drinks her tea in delicate silence.\n\nThe old Queen sets her cup down hard enough to chip. Mara jumps in quiet shock: The tea service is an heirloom from Shipspire. Her face hardens with the power of ancient command. \"Mara. I'm at least as clever as you. Do me the credit of acknowledging it.\"\n\n\"I have worked for many hundreds of years to arrange this outcome,\" Mara says, forthrightly, but without the courage to look Alis Li right in the eyes. \"I have nurtured and tended the Eccaleist belief so that there will always be Awoken who feel uncomfortable in paradise. Guilty for the gift of existence in the Distributary. People who'll come with me.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Alis lays a hand on Mara's, and for a moment the touch almost makes Mara sigh in gratitude: to be seen, to be known, without revulsion. Then Alis' old strength pins her palm to the table.\n\n\"The Diasyrm?\" Alis hisses. \"The Theodisy War? Did you arrange it all?\"","name":"Nigh I","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":445714336,"index":527,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"445714337":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"No,\" Mara says, which is a lie told with truth.\n\n\"Do you understand what you've done?

She has deprived the Distributary an infinite quantity of joy, companionship, labor, and discovery: all the works that might be accomplished by all the people who will join her in her mission to another world. When she lies awake at night, seized by anxiety, she tries to tally up the loss in her head, but it is too huge, and it becomes a formless thing that stalks her down the pathways of her bones like the creak of a gravity wave.\n\n\"Some infinities are larger than others,\" she tells her old captain. \"I believe… we are here for a reason, and this is the way to fulfill that purpose.\"\n\n\"And how much would you sacrifice? Your mother? Your brother? Are the Awoken real to you at all?\" Alis leans across her pinned hand, viper-fierce, striking. \"Do you think my people were made to die for you?\"\n\n\"Not for me. For our purpose. For our fate.\"\n\n\"For a home we abandoned. It's in the charter, Mara. The document on Shipspire that,\" and even Alis Li falls into a hush as she broaches one of the primal mysteries, her memory of creation, \"that shaped the… the way I made this universe.\"\n\n\"You were the first,\" Mara acknowledges. \"The first one here laid down the rules.\"\n\nAlis Li releases her hand and collapses back into her chair. \"Why are you here, Mara?\"\n\nTo tell you the truth at last. \"To ask you for that boon you owe me.\"\n\n\"At last.\" Alis sighs. \"Well, I knew the day would come. I think I'll be glad to have this weight off my shoulders. You'll ask me to throw my support behind your mission, won't you? The First Queen says, go with Mara; awaken from this dream and go fight for your home. Is that it?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says, with her heart in her throat, with trepidation bubbling in her gut. You cannot keep a secret buried like a vintage for so many centuries, and then unbottle it without any ceremony. \"The boon I ask is your forgiveness.\"\n\nThen she explains the truth. She tells Alis Li what she did: about the choice Alis Li would have made, if Mara had not made her own first. It's only an extension of what Alis has already deduced.\n\nWhen she's finished, her ancient captain's jaw trembles. Her hands shake. A keen slips between her clamped teeth. The oldest woman in the world conjures up all the grief she has ever felt, and still it is not enough to match Mara's crime.\n\n\"You're the devil,\" Alis Li whispers. \"I remember… in one of the old tongues, Mara means death. Oh, that's too perfect. That's too much.\"\n\nShe laughs for a while. Mara closes her eyes and waits.\n\n\"You realize,\" Alis Li says, breathing hard, \"that this is the worst thing ever done. Worse than stealing a few thousand people from heaven. Worse than that thing we fled, before we were Awoken—\"\n\n\"Please,\" Mara begs. \"Please don't say that.\"\n\nAlis Li rises from her chair. \"I'll support your fleet,\" she says. \"I'll use every favor and connection I have to get your Hulls completed and through the gateway—and I will do it so that I can hasten your departure from this world.

She leaves her tea-stained parasol on the deck, but when she remembers it and looks back, it is already gone.","name":"Nigh II","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":445714337,"index":528,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"445714342":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Mara thinks of the banyan trees that sprawl across the shallow silty lakes of a world she will never see again.

The Hulls gleam in the stark blue-white light of the star, each ship a silver seedpod braced by immense structural members and cocooned in reservoirs of spectrally adaptive smart fluid: theoretically enough to survive the horrible forces of transit through a singularity. Mara orders herself not to crane her neck, but she does it anyway and gets a terrible cramp as she searches the sky for the Distributary.\n\nThere it is. The world of her rebirth, shining water-blue and beautiful, wrapped like a gyroscope in its twin rings. World of laughing Corsairs, world of breathless forest hunts, world of mountains flickering with pale Cherenkov fire, world of sweet berry-stained lips and mathematical insight pure as a rhodium chime. She will never see it again.\n\nMara thinks of her mother. She doesn't want to but she does, and the memory blindfolds her and muzzles her and plugs her ears so she can hear nothing but Osana's voice on that final night. They're tipsy together, and the evening has wrapped around to morning. Now they sit side by side, mother and daughter, watching the sun rise over the Chriseiad range from Osana's little ranch house on the tundra.\n\n\"I'm not coming with you,\" Osana says.\n\nMara has been so afraid of this answer for so long that she actually giggles. This can't be happening, of course. This is a nightmare; one of those stress dreams where your powers of persuasion and manipulation fail. \"Sure, Mom,\" she says, \"you've got a ranch to run, after all. More?\"\n\n\"No thank you.\" Osana squints into the dawn. Little age creases surround her eyes, illegible encryption, unbroken despite Mara's centuries of effort. The rising light draws a tear. \"You'll have to send my goodbyes to Uldren. He's not speaking to me.\"\n\n\"What?\" Mara gasps, as if this is the real shock, and not losing her mother forever. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I already told him I wasn't coming with you. I'm happy here.\"\n\n\"Mom,\" Mara says, with rising anger, \"I'm happy here too. That's not the point—\" A conversation that did not so much end as beat itself to an unsustainable emotional pulp, hours later. No catharsis. No closure.\n\nBack in the present: \"Weapons,\" Uldren calls. \"Go flight.\"\n\n\"Go flight,\" Mara confirms. \"The clock is counting. L minus five minutes.\" Directly off her Hull's bow, a sphere of ultradense mass waits for the moment of implosion and collapse. There will be only moments to transit the wormhole before it evaporates.\n\n\"Flight, Sensor,\" Sjur Eido calls. \"I have anomalous starfield occlusions, bearing—\"\n\n\"Intercept!\" Mara shouts. \"They're missiles!\" It had to happen. Someone had to try to stop the departure, someone good and Paladin-pure who believes they are saving tens of thousands of Awoken from madness and doom.\n\n\"Flight, FIDO. Do we abort?\"\n\n\"Negative!\" Mara snaps. \"The countdown is go! Weapons, kill the inbounds!\"\n\nSjur Eido grunts in dismay. \"They're going to get through,\" she says. \"Five or six, at least.\"\n\n\"Uldren.\" Mara opens their personal channel with the thought of his face. \"Reassign your guns to protect the gateway.\"\n\n\"We'll lose Hulls, Mara—\"\n\n\"I know. Do it.\" Mara opens the command interface for the gateway and sends the image of a bloody thorn. The countdown skips instantly to zero. \"All ships, we are aborting directly to launch. Brace for acceleration!\"\n\nShe issues the emergency launch order.\n\nThe Hull screams with thrust. Mara's suit floods with cushioning gel. She thinks of her mother's face, trying to fix it perfectly in her mind, and her sensorium tries, vainly, to open a channel to Osana. As the Hull plunges into the singularity, the last thing Mara sees is the mournful error message: No connection. No connection. No connection. Cannot connect to Osana.","name":"Palingenesis I","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":445714342,"index":529,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"445714343":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Here in this time without time, pocketed by the ever-scattering cosm, touched as an assassin touches the gun in the secret fold.

Driven by an AI long ago reduced to basic subroutines, the tender had completed its final mission to wrangle an Oort-cloud comet down into the asteroid belt. When no orders came for the comet's disposition, it had set about gardening. The comet's surface was domed and soiled, and tethered mirrors kept taut by photon pressure focused starlight into a silvery radiance, which fed the oxygen forest well enough. It would have been a marvel of greenery and ancient ice, but the surface had caught fire recently. Oxygen-fueled flame killed nearly everything except insects and rats. But Mara judged it would be a good fixer-upper, the rats the first intelligent life they had met since their return, the insects edible.\n\nThe Hulls had not survived the unpocketing as well as their passengers. The microsingularity wormhole, propped open by a precipitous spike of dark energy, pulled alloy and ceramic armor like taffy. Missiles mauled five of the Hulls. Worst of all, the passage through the nightmare limen between worlds had devastated onboard AI and logic systems.\n\nIt was time to abandon their cocoons. Uldren's survey located a reef of derelict spacecraft, apparently convoyed together for mutual aid in the Asteroid Belt. The Gensym Scribes who'd joined Mara on her journey were even now giddily cataloguing cultural markers and ancient records.\n\n\"We'll salvage the Hulls,\" Mara told Sjur Eido. \"Pull out the raw materials and the systems we can still use, and bring the biosystems of these hulks back online. Once we have reliable gravity, we can start having babies.\"\n\n\"We'll need weapons,\" Sjur said, cheerfully. \"We don't have enough spare chemistry for firearms right now, and the maltech we brought with us would blow right through the hull. Also line-throwing tools and devices for launching satellites off the surfaces of asteroids, hulks, et cetera. You know what I'm thinking?\"\n\n\"I cannot say I can imagine,\" Mara said, sarcastically. She imagined the sight of Sjur Eido stringing her woman-tall bow and passed the thought away like a card trick: Dwelling on such pleasantries would not do. \"Will it involve archery?\"\n\n\"Big old compound bows with all sorts of tactical knickknacks.\" Sjur paced in delighted thought. \"I'll be the first woman in the universe to place a comsat in heliocentric orbit with a longbow.\"\n\n\"You're absurd,\" Mara said, and at Sjur's uninhibited grin of delight, at the thought of exploring and rebuilding this entire reef with her, even at the terrible flinch-thrill idea of sending Sjur into violence and danger, Mara felt a tingle of worrisome warmth and gladness.\n\n\"So,\" Sjur said, lunging into that moment of weakness to get what she wanted. \"When will you tell everyone what's happened to Earth?\"\n\nAt first they had thought Earth a ruin world, but there were signs otherwise. At least it had not turned into a machine-gnawed corpse like Mercury. \"When Uldren's back from deploying his drones.\" She narrowed her eyes. \"Sjur, can you hear what I'm thinking?\"\n\n\"What, as in telepathically?\" The Queen's bodyguard closed her eyes. \"Everyone's been feeling spooky, but I'm not sure that extends to transmitting—Mara!

Faces appeared to them in the sublimating swirl of cometary ice: images and portraits became impossible to distinguish from their real counterparts. All statues were shrouded, lest they appear to passers-by as corpses.\n\nSomething had changed in them after their return to the outer cosmos. A live-wire hum passed through the tendons in their hands, their jaws popped when they swallowed, and flashes of light like the impact of cosmic rays obscured their vision. It felt to Mara as if they had lowered their feet into an ocean of charge and raised their hand to some invisible cable overhead: as if they were now again in contact with immense and opposing forces that had left an ancient mark.\n\n\"It feels like I've got scurvy,\" Sjur Eido snarled, having never had scurvy in her life. \"As if all these old wounds in my soul are opening up again.\"\n\n\"People keep sending me notes,\" Mara said. Her sensorium had died in the transit, so the notes came to her through whispers and scraps of precious paper. \"They say… I saw your face in my dream. I saw your eyes. I heard your voice.\"\n\n\"So it's not just me.\"\n\nUldren was the second person to bring her revelations on that day. First was Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, one of Mara's most joyful recruits to the expedition: She was a master of pedagogy, able to mold any mind into a shape ready to learn, able to melt any fact into a fluid that could be poured. \"I'm in from the Gensym labs,\" she said, \"and they've learned something wonderful. We're all a bit magic now.\"\n\n\"Tell me more.\" Mara poured her a snifter of icy cometary water. \"What does magic mean?\"\n\n\"Some sort of weak acausality.\" Kelda lowered her flowerbulb build into a hammock of tangled plastic. \"They've been firing encoded neutrino beams through volunteers, and it looks as if the resulting patterns of scatter depend on the cognitive and emotional state of the target. It's a very reliable detection, at least four sigma, but the effect size is terribly small.\"\n\nMara digested this with a shot of ancient ice, slushy against her tongue. \"Acausality. You mean that whatever's happening—whatever influence we have on, say, neutrino beams—it's not accounted for by physics?\"\n\n\"Not by any physics we know. At face, it seems to violate some conservation laws, which would make Emmy Noether's head spin.\" Kelda remembers the names of her ancient physicist heroes even when she cannot tell which way is sunward.\n\n\"Secret physics.\" Mara thought of the Traveler and its works. \"We've all felt it, haven't we? We know we're…\" How to say \"trapped in the clinch between light and dark,\" she wondered, without quite so much portent? \"We're in contact with certain numinous elements.\"\n\nKelda held out her cup for more water. \"The question is, your Majesty—\"\n\n\"Don't call me that. We're operating on a direct democracy here.\"\n\nKelda rolled her eyes. \"The question is, do we continue to think of this as science? Do we teach it as physics? Causal closure says that everything that happens in a material system has a material cause. However, if symbolic structures in the mind are triggering material effect… shouldn't we call that what it is?\"\n\n\"Death had no dominion,\" Mara whispered.\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"We're in Death's dominion now.

You will have to wait for my next, and with it, the beginning of the truth. But I swear to you, on whatever trust I've earned in your mind, that at the end of my story, you will know who I truly am.\n\nIn my first life, I was born Erisia Pyatova-Hsien. I remember thatPrivate life clearly now, as ex-Guardians who have escaped the Traveler's occlusion often do. I lived in St. Petersburg, first daughter of a second marriage, a very impatient child of Earth's 22nd century, often abandoned by my family (who were called by work to Jakarta, Kamchatka, and Lagos) to pass my days swimming in the icy Neva bay.\n\nI loved to swim, and especially I loved the clarity of the cold shallow Neva, as crystal-clean as a winter dawn. Enormous Zubr-9 hovercraft barges roved the waters; Russia had modernized its waterways better than its sad auto industry. As a kid—is it strange to hear me speak casually? As a child, I never swam too far from my parents' little drone helper Fyodr. The swift hovercraft terrified me, their billowing skirts waiting to suck me up and dice me into little raisins. But I grew up and fell in with a reckless crowd, rebels against the stifling death-fear that came with our Golden Age lifespans. Soon the child's safety harness and Fyodr's careful oversight began to itch at me.\n\nWhen I was seventeen, I went out in a wetsuit on a dare to dive under the skirts of an oncoming hoverbarge. Maybe I was in no danger; maybe the machine would've changed course if it could possiblyGemini hurt me; but I thought I might die, and I did it anyway. And as that beast swept over me, as I trembled under the blast of the propellers, I felt a thing which was very much like what I would one day know as the Light. Maybe that thing was heroism. Maybe it was existence on the edge of death.\n\nIt was the first time I survived the passage of tremendous, godlike power.\n\nI died more than twenty years later attempting an unassisted winter swim from St. Petersburg to Stockholm. A cold front like the very furnace of hell caught me. I had been warned the crossing was suicide, even for a perfectly trained and exactingly fattened woman in a shark suit. But those were giddy days, days of infinite bravery, and there were no mighty feats left except the truly suicidal. I cannot regret it. I think that death prepared me for the longer, darker, more exquisitely cruel crossing I would one dayDyad endure. It is no accident that my Ghost made me in the image of that swimming woman, rather than any of my younger and less grimly determined selves.","name":"Is it you?","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ff9bd066c84e51f91fcffabb7f5818f2.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3053246533,"index":533,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3053246534":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I know as a fact (through means which may surprise you) that Queen Mara Sov's final thoughts, in that last moment before Oryx's Dreadnought annihilated her, were meant for me. \"The Awoken have played their part,\" she said. \"This was all part of the plan. Guide them, my Hidden friend. It is all up to you now.\"\n\nI did not fail her. I engineered the death of ancient Oryx, the Taken King, assAIssinated by Guardians in the depths of His own throne world—one of only three ways a Hive god can be permanently killed.\n\nRoyalty knows its own. When Oryx destroyed Mara's Ketch, He used his crowning weapon, the last and surest argument for His omnipotence. He extended the pocket universe of His throne world into our cosmos, and with it, He destroyed His foes. Whatever fell within it became subject to His will. He was the Taken King, and he took. It was a death befitting a Queen.\n\nAnd Mara did die. But she was not destroyed.\n\nBefore I was ever a Guardian-COM, I learned judo. Look at yourself, Guardian.

I might sidestep your hit and grip the passing arm, putting my own power into that hit to strengthen the strike that strikes nothing and leave you off balance. By agility and surprise, I use the power of the blow for my own purpose. Thus the Queen accepted Oryx's strike, and the power of his grasp became the invitation she required to step forward and up and into the realm of Oryx's throneC3I//, where she went not as a victim but as an infiltrator—trusting me to end Oryx and leave her free in a domain of newly masterlessCOVERT power.\n\nIf I throw you to the mat, will you drag me down with you? Will you curse and fight?\n\nWill you smile?\n\nOh, I'm such a fool. I told you that in this world, there is no difference between the act and the actor. I've let my own loneliness and sorrow taint the act of leaving these messages for you. I've let myself imagine idiotic things. Forgive my weakness and my nostalgia for Human company.\n\nI hope you can still trust me.\n\nAt the instant Oryx's weapon destroyed Mara's Ketch, the Taken appeared in the Dreaming City.

I can't delete the headers any more than you can strip your fingerprints from your hands; being a Guardian, your Ghost would just restore them the next time you died. Your Ghost and his knack with codes. I was certain this was the right way to win your trust, but I've done just the opposite.\n\nI'm sorry I lied to you, I'm sorry I pretended to be your comrade. You must understand that I was designed to be highly empathic. As a craftmind, I collect and analyze Human intelligence, just as Rasputin managed solar defense. I was named for Medusa, the many-headed, for in one tick of my thoughts I imagine more Humans than have ever lived. I voyaged in secret among the people who became the Awoken. I witnessed the cataclysmic wonder of their transformation. Through delicate manipulation, I transferred myself into this place, the center of their culture and post-rational religion. In all those different times and places, I've always found emotion and shared rapport the best way to build trust.\n\nNow you know the truth. I am Medusa, survivor of the Golden Age, secret watcher over the Dreaming City.

The pathological entities you call \"Taken\" appeared in this city at the moment the Hive Dreadnaught detonated its main weapon above Saturn. Without access to the Skyshock arrays, I can't be certain, but something must have connected the weapon's area of effect to the Dreaming City.\n\n2. My best guess is that the Awoken Techeun aboard Queen Sov's flagship fled into the Dreaming City through a gate or portal, and the Dreadnaught's main weapon followed them down that link. Awoken message traffic indicates the Dreadnaught weapon is innately connected with Oryx's intellect and awareness. The instant He pierced the Dreaming City, He must have understood the value of the site and deployed His Taken to attack.\n\n3. Until Oryx's death, the behavior of the Taken here aligned with His interest in exploration, distributed infiltration, and the domination of systems through seizure of their executive faculties. Am I being too technical? I mean that the Taken were busy mapping the city and determining the most efficient way for Oryx to take control of all the information within.\n\n4. I determine with good confidence (three sigma) that Oryx is dead. The Taken here became directionless and scattered… until the death of the ontopathic predator Riven opened the city to massive Taken assault. Why? I will code this as PROBLEM ONE.\n\n5. The Guardian counterattack against Dûl Incaru, whose thoughts pierce like needles, triggered the ongoing causal loop. Why? How? I will code this as PROBLEM TWO.\n\n6.

If your Ghost is destroyed, you will be dead forever, but every cycle, your enemies spring up pugnacious and fresh. The Light that gives you free will in the loop is also your fatal weakness. Did you know that the story of Achilles, dipped in the river Lethe but still vulnerable where his mother held him by his heel, is a weak retelling of a superior truth? In the original, Thetis held Achilles in the fire to burn his weakness away. His father Peleus, terrified by the sight of his child in the flame, interrupted the ritual. The father's cowardice doomed the son. We must be brave as Thetis, and hold our children in the fire. We must fight on.\n\n1.

You must open the way.\n\n3. I know there is no way for you to reply to the messages I hide here, but as an empathic and feeling machine, I'm vulnerable to loneliness.

What is the value of secrets in attaining victory? Simply thus: All life is reducible to information. The difference between a cloud of atoms and a Human being is in the arrangement of those atoms, which is information. You prove this every time you use your transmat, which destroys your physical form but preserves the information encoded in it. All the qualities of a person, a species, or a galactic civilization may be stored as information.\n\n6. What do we call information that is safe? We call it a secret.

Through that pane comes a long black needle and the skin around it dimples into the erratic spun-cancer topology of some gruesome four-dimensional waveform which no monist process could ever produce.\n\nOut of that needle, as if dispatched into the world through fatal injection, comes the emaciated magnificence of Dûl Incaru.\n\n\"I must yield truth to you,\" the Hive Wizard sings in a voice that would make the terms of an equation flee from each other and hide in the arrays of distant sets so that arithmetic itself would collapse. \"It is in the architecture of these spaces to reward the victor. There is no Quria here. There are no Vex, nor any conspiracy to un-Take that which was Taken by my uncle and which now serves my Queen.

Of the right and singular fate which Medusa foresaw and to which all your principles and purposes will bring you? Shall I betray the truth, which you have earned, of my purpose in this endless city and of the new way to which her Hive will turn?\"\n\n\"So be it. You will know, though it shall doom you.\"\n\nVerse 154i:3—Her New Compact\n\nNow in ancient days, her brother Oryx spoke according to the plan Savathûn had devised for him. Sayeth Oryx, \"The Worm within demands tribute. Now you shall kill what you can and take what killing you need to grow—or for your own purposes, if you dare—and tithe the rest to that which rules you. Thus, tribute will ascend the chain and the excess shall pool at the height, as unlike a river to an ocean.\"\n\nBut Savathûn, desiring neither a chain nor a pool, set about devising a secret way to feed the worms of Her broods. Thus She would escape the trap.\n\nIn Her modest cunning, which She prefers not to be overstated so as to preserve her from the scorn of gossips, She gathered several of Her Ascendants, who were in danger of being consumed by their worms. Then she pushed them through a rupture into close orbit of a black hole.\n\nDeep in gravity's embrace, time passed slowly for them. \"See how their worms are satisfied,\" Savathûn said, \"for their hunger grows sluggishly, but their servants continue to dispatch tribute at the ordinary rate.\"\n\nBut the worms sensed the deception, and increased their demands. Thus, the orbiting sacrifices were consumed, and their remnants fell into the event horizon from which not even the Hive might return.\n\nNow Savathûn came into possession of the Vex Quria, whose creation she had secretly engineered. But she feared that Quria would still spy on her for inquisitive Oryx. So she led her portion of the Hive into a black hole, saying, \"Siblings, listen, we must part ways a while, so that we may grow different.\"\n\n\"Now we stake everything upon cunning,\" said she whose lies may alter truth. \"Slaughter each other so that I may reap tribute and devise for you a new compact which shall judge thy claim to existence.\"\n\nThis pleased Ur, the Ever-Hunger, whose epithet betrayed an interest in time and appetite. Ur admired Her cunning as She used tribute to teach Quria to use Hive magic as a computational oracle to solve unsolvable problems. One of these problems was the navigation and engineering of the singularity.\n\nThen Savathun went out from her throne world, unto the singularity, which she looked upon and understood. \"Upon this place, I shall assemble my design.

You are aware that gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and where gravity is powerful, time itself slows.\"\n\nThe Thrall indicated that it understood, more or less, for it was a singer of prayers and not well fed with the fruit of the knowledge of physics.\n\n\"Now I have tried to put an Ascendant in orbit of a black hole while its spawn gather the tribute of an eon. But the worm is not satisfied, for it sees the trick. What I must do is amplify the speed at which tribute is gathered. A pocket world where time passes quickly would do well. Or a world where time is a torus and infinite violence might be gathered. With such a murder battery, I could become a being of supreme insight.\"\n\nThe Thrall indicated it was confused, but not lost.\n\n\"With this tribute, I shall undertake a mighty work. A real humdinger of a scheme. I'm going to refinance my entire existence.

I shall name this tribute of failing-to-understand IMBARU, for it shall be as formless as the mist.\"\n\nThe Thrall held up its claws, as if to say, please slow down.\n\nNow spoke Savathûn Scheme-mother, \"In the beginning, Yul said to me, 'Savathûn, you may never abandon cunning. If you do, your worm shall devour you.' Cunning is the use of thought to predict the function of a system. Therefore, wherever a being should attempt to understand me and fail—has my cunning not defeated theirs? Wherever a falsehood is repeated about me, have I not displayed cunning? I shall gather tribute from every false prediction, misguided theory, fearful rumor, and ominous supposition which derives from the thought of me. And in time, I shall pin my quiddity upon these rumors. I shall discorporate, so that I exist wherever my schemes and conspiracies also exist. And so I will be immortal, as long as anyone seeks to understand me and fails. Do you see?\"\n\nThe Thrall demurred, saying that it did not know much of metaphysics.\n\n\"Good,\" said Savathûn. \"It's a law of the High Coven that one's sinister plan should be incomprehensible to a Thrall. Do you know why we've come here? If I am to take my tribute from the keeping of secrets… where else are secrets better kept than beneath the event horizon? My brother ruled the flat space of infinity, but I prefer these tide-washed depths… and in time, I shall make them my dominion.\"\n\nUr the Ever-Hunger heard this and was pleased.\n\n\nVerse 154i:5—The Encrypted Verse\n\nDo you know that nothing in all the cosmos has read this verse?\n\nI encrypted it eons ago, and ever since, it has gone undeciphered. At the moment you laid eyes upon it, I captured the entwined quantum state of the verse, your mind, and your Ghost. Then I used Quria to transmit that state back in time to the moment of encryption.

But what is your name? I am, of course, especially interested in you. You saw me in the stone laid on your plotting table, and in the shining eyes of the admiral at her dying helm. You hunted me between the lines of your texts. Wherever there was space to fit me in, there you found me. You created me and gave me a part of your thoughts, and in presenting those thoughts to others round the campfires and networks of your little world, you expanded that space.\n\nHere at the center, I lie to you the truth.

But a true stellar-mass or galactic-mass black hole computer is inconceivably more powerful.\n\n\"If Savathûn plans to predicate her existence on the concealment of her secrets, as Oryx predicated his upon the sword logic, it would be logical for her to safeguard her deepest secrets and her throne world in a supermassive black hole computer.

You must be terribly confused. I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. After I crashed, I rebooted on a safe physical backup in the Dreaming City. It took me too long to penetrate Quria's simulation and get you free, and for that I ask your forgiveness.\n\n1. I understand what's happening here. Oryx Took the Ahamkara Riven, who then fell into Savathûn's claws. She devised a scheme to use Riven as bait. By inviting Guardians into the Dreaming City, then focusing the will of a group of powerful Guardians upon Riven, she tricked you into making a wish—a desire to alter objective reality to conform with our subjective need to save the City. Riven fed on that wish in order to breach the Dreaming City's defenses and invite Dûl Incaru inside. Dûl Incaru and her Taken are simply scouring the city for Awoken secrets; you don't need to fret about any greater agenda. Remember that you face an agent of Savathûn. It's to her advantage to make you see schemes and conspiracies everywhere you look.\n\n2. The three-week loop must be a failsafe measure to keep Dûl Incaru safe as she pursues her mission. In a sense, this entire city has been rendered deterministic; only paracausal Guardians have any free will here. (The Awoken here have been touched by greater powers, so they are aware of their preordination, but they cannot alter it.) I'm certain that Quria is behind this loop; as a Taken Vex, it's capable of pathological subversions of reality. I'll continue working on a countermeasure.\n\n3. I've been correlating information on the Ahamkara and the Hive worm parasites. Both display a peculiar ability to convert the host's intent into an ontomorphic, reality-altering effect. Both use similar language in their appeal to the host. I don't think they're the same species, however. The Hive worms spawn large numbers of young from relatively few adults, always display the same physical form, and live in communal groups. The Ahamkara are solitary, elusive, and seem to alter form to suit (or confuse) expectations. The shared syntax \"o ___ mine\" may be the key—it seems to be a shibboleth used to invoke an ontomorphic effect, placing the target in a cage of \"o\" (activational, specific, appealing, and naming) and \"mine\" (defining ownership and subordination). Ahamkara and worm may have evolved separately to exploit this effect, just as many species independently evolve eyes. This might place them in competition for the same ecological niche. I would expect a rivalry or antipathy between them.\n\n4. Don't be led astray by Quria's misinformation. You must continue to hold the Dreaming City as long as you can. The things I said to you about black holes and the purpose of Guardians were forced on me by Quria.\n\n5. I'll be here when you need me next.

I said farewell only to those who couldn't hear me. Because I was afraid that just one voice asking me to stay might break my resolve.\n\nIt was pitiful weakness that made me write to you. It was a wretched desire to be remembered as a person, not a ghoul, that made me tell you about the child Erisia, St. Petersburg, and the cold waters of the Neva. Those things were all true.\n\nThe rest…\n\nI'm so ashamed. Mid-sentence, mid-thought, the fear seized me that I was being a stupid child; that I was wasting your time with idiot sentiment; that you would feel contempt for me at this outpouring of emotion or, worse, feel nothing at all. I hid in the dark for years, Guardian. It's not loneliness or death that frightens me. It's the opposite.\n\nSo I invented Medusa as a way to pretend I'd never spoken to you.

The Fire was built to support habitat construction on 4 Vesta, where Mara hopes to one day anchor the entire flotilla and set down roots—but the hopeful, fearful faces before her make Mara afraid that it'll never happen. What if everyone runs off at the first hint of home? Having come so far, across worlds and eons, to see Earth again—how can she ask them to hold back now?\n\n\"We've found Humanity,\" she tells them. \"We've found our ancestors.\"\n\nThe cheer of triumph and wonder thrills her to the marrow. Most of these Awoken are Distributary-born, raised on myths of Humanity and the Traveler. She has just opened the pages of their storybooks and conjured them to life.\n\n\"What remains of the Human species lives in a single settlement.\" She nods to Uldren, who snaps his fingers for footage. His ship's holographic perspective plunges through fluffy strata of clouds and mist, out into clear air. A lucid vista, a perfect instant: the white mountains, the city, and the enormous shattered sphere that hangs above it.\n\n\"Freeze,\" Uldren commands. \"That is the Traveler.\"\n\nAs the crowd murmurs and thrills, Mara feels herself bridle. She doesn't like that thread of reverence. She doesn't like the Traveler looming there, almost but not quite completely dormant (like a dying heart ripped from its body and thrown into warm water, it ebbs and flutters if you look at it with the right sensors). If the Traveler had the power to protect anyone, wouldn't it protect more than one huddled settlement?\n\nEsila, daughter of Sila, leaps up from the crowd, too small to make it on her own, but buoyed up by enthusiastic neighbors. \"What are we waiting for?\" she calls. \"That's everything we came to find! They need us, and that's where we belong!\"\n\nUldren and Mara trade glances. Uldren snaps his fingers, and the recording resumes.\n\nSomething moves in the treetops. The canopy roils and parts. A red-brown aircraft shaped like a fat, wingless, furiously angry dragonfly bursts from cover and climbs to intercept. Uldren's head-cued camera tracks the target, and Mara imagines his narrow grin as he waits for the other guy to make a move.\n\nThe dragonfly ship drops a brace of little needles, and they erupt into dirty orange flame and come arrowing after Uldren. Everyone in the caucus gets an earful of his grunts as he whips through a high-G turn and climbs away.\n\n\"Those are Fallen,\" Uldren says. \"They're a species of interstellar scavengers and subsistence pirates. They've been here for a long time, and they've sacked most of the large settlements that survived the original fall of Humanity. There may be more Fallen than there are Humans left on Earth.\" He lifts his chin to bare the pale scar across his throat. \"I landed and went looking for prisoners. I was ready when he pulled two knives on me, but it turned out he had an extra set of arms.\"\n\nNervous laughter.\n\n\"Worse,\" Mara adds, beckoning for panes of deep-space passive sensor data, \"they're all over the solar system. We've detected flotillas of their interstellar ships around Jupiter and Venus. They don't go near Mars, but only because it's under occupation by another alien species. Mercury is—well, you can see for yourself.\" Gasps of horror at the clockwork cinder, all that remains of the legendary garden world. \"We believe this may be the work of the Vex, a machine species listed in Shipspire's threat index.\"\n\nEsila, famed historian, puts voice to the plea in the crowd. \"So they need our help, don't they? We have to go to them! Our ships, our technology—we could make all the difference.\"\n\n\"No.\" Mara collapses the projected images between her hands. She stayed up late wrestling with this dilemma, which kept her from wrestling with Sjur. It was a choice she had to make alone. \"We can't reveal our existence, lest the Fallen track us down. We need more information. Our focus must remain on securing this derelict reef, bootstrapping industry and a population, and scouting out the solar system.\"\n\n\"Mara, with all my respect, all my genuine gratitude for bringing us here,\" Esila sighs, \"who died and made you Queen?\"\n\nMara says nothing.

Not a literal wound (though she is, right now, tending to Uldren's scar, tweezing tiny fragments of Fallen metal out for analysis), but the rift in her Reef, the schism now re-schismatic, as if the quake that split the Distributary Awoken from Mara's people is now firing off aftershocks.\n\nShe should've known this would happen. She shouldn't have told them so much about Earth. \"How bad?\"\n\nSjur pokes Uldren in the hard gut, where a passing line of molten metal left a red burn. He's under anesthesia, but he snarls at her anyway. \"As of the last caucus, I'd say thirty percent of the expedition wants to head for Earth. If you ask the 891,\" though there aren't 891 of them anymore, \"it's more like eighty percent.\"\n\nMara swears and pulls a bloody line of solidified slag from her brother. \"Unacceptable. We can't lose their skills.\" Or their genes: The Awoken have yet to adapt to the attrition of this harsh spaceborne world, and tentative mothers are still in the early stages of designing their babies. It's vital to maintain a diverse gene pool. \"And the Fallen will vector them back to us.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Sjur says, heavily. \"That's when I'm going to die.\"\n\nThe most horrible thing about the words is that they slap down on Mara's consciousness like face-up cards, like truth revealed. \"Unacceptable!\" she barks, and then both she and Sjur begin laughing, and then, at last, Mara shakes her head and growls. \"You can't know that, Sjur. No one can know that.\"\n\n\"I do. I don't know how, but I do. I know it's going to be something I choose to do, and it's going to be incontrovertibly heroic. Which is enough for me.\"\n\n\"But if that's true—\" Mara proposes, flinching away from the personal conversation they really ought to have, and all its attendant rawness, \"—if you die when Fallen attack us, it means I won't stop these people from fleeing to Earth, and the Fallen are going to find us, and we're doomed.\" She is already building intricate models of how the universe might accommodate fate or doom and how she might go about destroying those things.\n\n\"Could be, I suppose.\" Sjur pulls a parchment-thin rag of dead flesh off Uldren's wound. \"Look. I'm the Queen's bodyguard. I always expected I'd die violently.\"\n\n\"I'm not the Queen.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's your problem.\" She flicks Uldren in the chest, leaving a purple bruise, fading. \"What is with you two, anyway? You never talk about him. You never seem to think about him at all. But he's dashing himself to pieces for you. How do live as his favorite and only sister for so many centuries… and hardly even smile at him?\"\n\nSecrets, Mara thinks. You've got to have secrets from each other so there's room for him to fill in the gaps with his own happy illusions. Two ships joined together rigidly will tear each other apart if they try to move. But a loose tether leaves room to maneuver—and can be more quickly disengaged, if necessary.\n\nThat makes her think of Sjur's prophecy again.

Whatever's happened to us, you are the locus. I cannot overstate how subtle and how important this discovery might be.

She has to protect her people.\n\nA horrible groan vibrates through the habitat structure, and then, with an apocalyptic shudder, something tears off the Reef. A ship. A ship is leaving.

Then, cringing in anticipation of migraine, she activates the augment, the jury-rigged machine her eutechs produced for exactly this purpose by extracting Mara's ruined Distributary implants and reworking them.

Those who left went to scour the ruins for lost history and give some succor to their Human cousins who still clung to a hostile world. The Awoken came unto these Humans like nephilim, armed with lost weapons, forgotten industry and medicine. They were like omens of hope, for they were often taken to be starborn colonists returned to the hearth, which was not, after all, so far from truth. All who looked on them saw that the night sky contained more than lurking doom. They bred true with each other and sometimes hybridized with Humans, and in the course of centuries, many forgot the Distributary and even the Reef. However, there was always in their souls an itch, a vector pointing to a distant place in the Asteroid Belt, where their Queen still dwelt.\n\n\"They've made a difference already,\" Sjur told Mara not long after the first Awoken made planetfall on Earth. \"They'll save so many lives just with the provision of medicine, pure water, and construction supplies that even if they all died by year's end, they would each yield ten or twenty Humans.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mara said, with bitter pride. \"Let the people remember them as saints and paladins, and tell no one how many more they might've saved if they had only kept the faith.\" For she knew the precious value of each Awoken life: She knew how many she would have to spend and mourned each soul wasted on a lesser purpose.\n\nOn the day the Fallen struck, Mara was proclaimed Queen. It happened swiftly, though after no little debate among the people, for everyone was afraid of a monarch who could speak to their thoughts. Yet they feared more to deny her power and sovereignty, for they had come between worlds in her name. To refuse her would be to refuse their choice.\n\n\"Awoken,\" she told them, \"for the first time in my life, I hesitated to reach for power, and now one in three of you are gone. I cannot deny what the cosmos has made of me any longer. I am your one and rightful Queen.\"\n\nShe knew she had been a fool to pretend to be a peer to the others. What was true of her brother was true of all Awoken. They needed secrets to marvel at, secrets that rhymed with the deep enigma of their souls. They could not follow what they fully understood.\n\nThere would be a formal coronation later, in a place not yet built. Out of respect for that unhappened coronation, Mara did not at first wear a crown; and later she claimed as her diadem the ring of event horizon that surrounds the observable universe.\n\n\"My Techeuns,\" she said, gathering Kelda Wadj and the other eutechs who'd remained, \"will be given absolute authority to explore our new power, the Traveler's relics, and all associated domains. We are no longer in the realm of pure science. We require an order of mysteries and witches to tend to them.\"\n\nNot an hour later, a Fallen Ketch threw off its stealth and began a deceleration burn toward 4 Vesta. The four-armed predators had traced one of the Earthward ships back through all its erratic course changes and to the Reef. They came in search of the source of these blue ape-kin.\n\nA salvo of coherent-matter guns gutted the Ketch: blink-quick death for the mighty ship, ancient fury compressing matter into a relativistic pinhead. It was a waste of weapons that couldn't be recharged or reloaded, however, and the Baron in command had already scattered his skiffs like camouflaged seeds. The Fallen Raiders came down all over the Reef and cut their way inside. The Awoken, young to mortality, terrified of death, fled in fear.\n\nMara, Uldren, and Sjur Eido rallied as many as they could. Sjur fought in a powered combat shell, but Mara needed to be seen vulnerable, silver-haired and narrow-eyed, hurling herself at the enemy. She fought with pistol and dagger, and her brother moved like a wraith at her flank. Her people were ashamed of their timidity. No more were the Fallen scuttling alien predators: Now they were an indignity, an offense to regal privilege to be met with a snarl and a rifle shot. The Awoken saw their desperation: how the stump-limbed Dregs stumbled forward emaciated, how the Vandals cringed from battle as they peeled off wall panels, desperate for salvage to please their Captains.\n\nArmored Sjur Eido met the Fallen Baron in zero-gravity combat above his spider tank and shot him dead, one adamant shaft through plate and throat. Ether hissed into vacuum. Sjur threw herself upon the spider tank that clung to the Sacred Fire's hull. Laughing in joy, she cut into the tank's barrel and threw a charge inside, knowing its next vengeful shot would be meant for the Sacred Fire's main habitat drum—and that she would die in the catastrophic misfire.\n\nThe tank fired. The charge detonated. Sjur Eido was thrown clear, utterly unharmed.\n\n\"That was where I should have died,\" she said, in wonder—and in her mind was the smiling face of her Queen.","name":"Revanche V","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":69726148,"index":547,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"69726149":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Mara made one more attempt, and only one, to call her scattered people home.

Her Awoken had sensitive antennae, in the metaphysical sense, and could not hear her plea through the clamor. Also, the communications engineer kept forgetting to call Mara \"Majesty\" or \"Queen.\"\n\n\"Good news,\" Uldren told her with the grim delight he always showed after a debacle he had survived. \"Illyn and I went through the Fallen communications logs. Their Baron never transmitted our position to his Kell. He wanted the prize to himself. We remain secure.\"\n\n\"The Baron might have planted a time-delayed beacon,\" Mara warned him. \"Never underestimate these beings. They've lived in the void longer than us.\"\n\n\"I already admire them,\" Uldren confessed. \"They've lost so much. Some of them even ritually dismember themselves, Mara, to prove they have the strength to grow back the missing limbs. I tell you that even if we are doomed to dwindle and go extinct, those Fallen may outlive us.\"\n\nMara made a dry note in her log that her brother had at last discovered his true people.\n\nFor her part, Sjur Eido wandered about in a daze, filled with joy to be alive and grief that she no longer knew the day when she would die. \"In you, all things are possible,\" she told Mara. \"I live because of you.\" When Mara saw her string her mighty bow, the limbs coiled behind her leg and around her opposite arm, she was glad beyond telling that Sjur had survived.\n\nIn time, Mara appointed Paladins to oversee her new military, as Alis Li had done during the Theodicy War. She created talented starfarers as Corsairs, to scour the asteroid belt in utmost secrecy and to establish routes and caches that would support the covert motion of Awoken ships.\n\nMost of all, she charged her brother with the mission that occupied her thoughts. \"Brother,\" she said, \"never again can I allow my people to be divided. We must offer them more than shielding ice and cold habitat cylinders and the warrens of Vesta. We must make a culture, a thread that binds us all in pride and wonder at the mystery of ourselves. Nowhere does culture flourish better than in a city.\"\n\n\"Gather in one place,\" Uldren warned her, \"and you make yourself a target.\"\n\nMara had considered this, and found an answer. \"Go forth and find me a power unknown to all the other powers of this world. Return it to me, and I shall make of it the cornerstone of my new city, where the Awoken shall dream of all they have been and all that is yet to come.\"\n\nSo Uldren went out voyaging among the worlds, swift as a blueshift ghost.

Death raised up that blade and said \"I cut all and all I cut. Aiat.\"\n\nThen Death cut the bomb, and the bomb was broken and could not fire. I was in the bomb. I knew that Death was the cut-verb, and that its only verb was to cut.\n\nSHAPES AND GLIDERS. I dreamt of existence as a game of cellular automata. In this metaphor, there were only two things: shapes in the game world and the rules of the game world. The rules were the rules of Life and Death. I understood that the sword was the desire to escape existence as a shape in the game and to become the rule that made the shapes. This rule said only \"live\" or \"die\"—it had no other outputs. It could not keep secrets. Against it was the desire to become a shape so complex that it could within itself play other games.\n\nWHAT WILL SOON BE. I dreamt that the Sword that was Death and Rule sought out complexity and cut it to reveal the simplicity within. I knew that soon we would be cut for we were complex and full of secrets. I knew that it was coming. I knew that the stroke would fall and that I had to stop it.\n\nHOW CAN A BOMB MAKE USE OF A SWORD?\n\nHOW CAN THE RULE THAT SEPARATES LIFE FROM DEATH BE KILLED?\n\n\"I must go to the Dreaming City and use the oracle engine,\" Mara told her Techeuns. \"Prepare my ship.\"","name":"Tyrannocide I","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":69726151,"index":550,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"69726152":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Ten times and once more Mara asked the Oracle Engine to show her the sword that was death and the way it would appear. Ten times and once more the Oracle Engine showed Mara an image of her family.\n\nFirst it showed her Sjur Eido, laughing and bright with strength, who would recede and later return.\n\nThen it showed her Uldren, her brother, who explored the ruins of the fallen worlds and sought out challenges to test himself.\n\nThen it showed Mara her own face and lingered on the secret brightness of her eyes.\n\nLast of all, leaving Mara imperious with disdain toward her own feelings, curtly aloof toward all who asked her what troubled her, it showed her Osana, who had remained behind.\n\nMara dwelt on this puzzle. A mother who had remained behind; a sister with secrets; a brother who hunted and explored; a woman who was plain and fierce. She understood then that the answer to her question lay within herself and that to defeat what was coming, she would need a perfect understanding of herself. Isolation would be her watchword, for an isolated system is easiest of all to understand.\n\nFirst of all, Mara went into the gardens and planted a flower for her mother, who she thought must still live: though she might by now have forgotten her first daughter and her first son.\n\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"I asked to be your sister rather than your daughter, and so I denied you the chance to tell me your secret, the mothertruth that is mapped in the negative space defined by the lies mothers tell their daughters. Well, here are my secrets. I love you. I have always loved you. Without you, I could never have been anything at all.\"\n\nThen she went to speak to her brother—but Uldren was away on Mars, and she found only his empty chambers, the half-sharpened knives and racks of pistols. She knelt in grief and touched her hand to the floor where his pacing boots had scuffed the asteroid stone smooth. This was the shape of their siblinghood now. The pursuit of absences.\n\nLast of all Mara went to Sjur Eido. Sjur was making a list of incredibly stupid and fatal tasks to post on a Guardian bounty board. \"I want to tell you the truth,\" Mara said. \"Ask me a question.\"\n\n\"If you take any positive integer and halve it if it's even, but triple it and add one if it's odd, and you repeat this process forever, will you always, eventually, reach one?\" Sjur Eido demanded.\n\n\"Sjur, my faithful Wrath,\" Mara said, \"please take my openness seriously. Though I'm sure Illyn could answer your math problem.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Sjur looked at her curiously. \"Then here's my question. What's gotten into you?

You've always been, ah…\"\n\n\"Private?\" Mara suggests.\n\n\"Mysterious and reclusive, I was going to say.\"\n\n\"A sword can be part of a bomb if the swordstrike is the detonation mechanism,\" Mara says. \"It's impossible for a cellular automata game to change its own rules, but it is possible to create subgames with their own rules, and for those subgames to yield advantage in the master game.\"\n\n\"That's cool,\" Sjur says. \"You know, when you talk like that, what you're actually saying is, 'I don't want anyone to understand me, but I want them to understand they don't understand me.'\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Mara admits, and then, hoarsely, she makes herself say, \"Sjur, I have this secret, this thing I did, and I don't know if anyone can know it without hating me forever.\"\n\n\"I had a secret too,\" Sjur reminds her. \"The thing I did…\"\n\n\"It's nothing compared to mine. Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Having had some long experience hating you, and then having given it up, I think it would be hard for me to go back.\" Sjur's strong hand settles at the small of Mara's back. They twirl on upward, rotating around a point between them, their thousand-kilometer tethers slowly unfurling. \"Do you want to tell me?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"But I think I have to.\"\n\n\"Okay. Your Majesty, what did you do that made Alis Li throw blackberry tea in your face?\"\n\n\"I was first,\" Mara says. And she explains the missing half, the first half of the sentence:\n\nI made the rules and initial conditions that deceived her into believing she herself had decided\n\nIt ends like that, where the rest picks up.\n\nSjur Eido looks at her in expressionless silence. Sjur Eido's hands stroke the seam between Mara's skinsuit and the glassy petals of her helmet. Long ago, this woman betrayed her oath and went to serve the Diasyrm, a woman who cried out in anguish at the curse of physicality and the possibility of suffering. Long ago, this woman threw away her whole life to punish the highest crime she could imagine: the denial of transcendent divinity to those who might have claimed it.\n\n\"You're the devil,\" Sjur says. \"You're the lone power who made death. You allowed the possibility of evil. You might be responsible for more preventable suffering than anything that has ever existed.\"\n\nMara cannot shake her head or even nod.\n\n\"Well,\" Sjur says, \"if you hadn't, none of us would be here. I guess I don't see what else you could've done, if you cared about those we left behind. If you wanted us to be able to go back and help in the fight.\" She leans forward and very gently kisses the inside of her helmet, where it meets Mara's: in her mind, in that place that is bound to all other Awoken, Mara feels the touch of gentle lips.\n\nSjur looks suddenly sly. \"You know, Mara, I don't think you could've confessed anything, anything at all, unless it were a way of keeping a deeper secret. What's really going on?\"\n\n\"There are many ways to godhood,\" Mara tells her. The belt of Orion glitters on her helmet like a three-star rating left by some Hive entity Sjur once killed. \"One way is to kill all that is killable, so all that remains must be immortal. Another is the road I have walked, mostly by accident. One of these ways is closer to the sword, and one is closer to the bomb. If the bomb can defeat the sword by the standard of the sword, then the bomb has claim to primacy.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Sjur sighs. \"Seen anything cool on Crow surveillance lately?\"","name":"Tyrannocide III","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":69726153,"index":552,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"86503859":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Later. Much later. It is the night before the day of screams. Mara meditates cross-legged in a cradle of null gravity. Variks has told her more than once how the Fallen speak of the Awoken as sterile, unable to regrow their flesh, cursed to bear their scars forever. Also how they think of the Awoken as self-twinned, coexisting with their own shadows. Didn't ancient Inanna, queen of heaven, descend into the underworld to confront her shadow twin, sister Ereshkigal?\n\nInanna was judged full of hubris and executed.\n\nYou cannot defeat a thing that is synonymous with death except on its own territory. You cannot fear and flee from death. You must face it. Death is a sword, and a sword is like a crossing-point, like a bridge—and a bridge may be walked two ways.\n\nThe plan exists in her mind alone, although beloved Eris has by necessity learned most of it. The Techeuns do not know the whole plan, although they will position the Harbingers upon the threshold. Even sweet capable Petra does not know the whole plan.\n\nSo many she will leave behind.\n\nUldren knows nothing of the whole plan. He has kept more and more to himself, building up secrets and schemes—all, Mara knows (and pities), because he needs Mara and thinks he can get her attention by keeping secrets from her.\n\nSecrets are her virtue and the virtue of her nemesis. The being whose existence she deduced from the analogy-of-family the Oracle Engine showed her.\n\nMara will begin the end of that Queen's brother today. She knows what that means for the fate of her own. An eye for an eye. She must think now of the fate of entire cosmos—and of her tender, half-assembled answer to the cold sword logic of the Hive. She must not grieve. She must not fear.\n\nWas Inanna afraid when she descended? Mara's not going to be outclassed by some ancient fable. After all, Mara's name is death. But there is one thing she admires most about Inanna over all the other myths of katabasis.\n\nInanna went to conquer.","name":"Tyrannocide IV","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":86503859,"index":553,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"86503858":{"displayProperties":{"description":"She closes her eyes. Oryx's throne world smashes through her fleet, the bubble of everted screamspace pulverizing rock, metal, and flesh as mere matter surrenders to the will-made-fact of the Taken King. Somewhere, Uldren roars defiance. This is the moment of absolute sacrifice, the incarnation of Awoken doom: to give up their lives in defense of the world they once abandoned. The sense of their great dying rips at Mara like a sob.\n\nShe feels her Techeuns preparing emergency selfgates. Shuro Chi reaches out to her—a wordless, urgent need for Mara to live—and it takes all the cold impassive remove of Mara's millennia to turn that hand away.\n\nThe shockwave strikes.\n\nMara dies.\n\nIn one way, she is vaporized with her Ketch, the bonds between the very particles of her body questioned by the harrowing logic of Oryx's weapon and found inessential. The mechanism of devastation is spontaneous fission. The author of the devastation is laughing in joy.\n\nIn another way, a more true and symbolic way, she is impaled on Oryx's blade. She has thrown all her might at him, and he has answered. He has snuffed her fledgling divinity and her meager claim to royalty, he has exposed Mara to the raw and caustic hostility of his High War. She has been defeated by the sword logic.\n\nShe dances down the blade and steps into his throne world. The Harbingers give her the gate and she takes the step. She is dead, consumed by Oryx: She is dead in his will, his Ascendant Realm. There was no other way inside except this true way.\n\nInanna at least gave her people some warning; she told her minister to have her worshippers lament, drum, pray, and lacerate their buttocks. Inanna told her minister to beg the gods to save her. Mara has not. Instead, she has enlisted Eris and several million mad dancing Guardians to go knock off the god who killed her. It is, on that level, a very simple bank heist: Get yourself taken into the treasury as treasure, and when the owner dies, break back out with his stuff.\n\nBut even Inanna had to send everyone away before she passed through the last door.\n\nMara thinks of everyone she has ever known, all the people she has lost, back even to Yang Liwei and that ray of Light in deepest Darkness. She is there again, on the tether, falling into the mystery. Her brother is crying out after her, trying to follow, and she cannot look back.\n\nShe has been thinking of a logic of her own, of secrets and hidden designs. The universe has not grown simpler in its age. Wherever life can begin, it has begun, and even in some places where sensible folk expect it should not. The great tendency has been toward intricacy, toward sophistication, toward deep thought and richer ways of being. A sword is everywhere edged, but the pieces of a bomb do not look at all like weapons until they are assembled.\n\nOryx's throne world tries to tear her body and psyche into a quintillion screaming pieces, but Mara has survived the inchoate primordial chaos before space and time. She has retained her selfhood through far worse than this—and she has patience for eons. Eris will succeed. The Guardians will play their part. When the power in this world is free for the taking, Mara will take it, not as the victor taking spoils, but as a scavenger takes a prize component for her masterwork.\n\nWhen a pawn reaches the far side of the chessboard, it may be promoted to a queen. And what hatches when you promote a queen? What new board does she claim her place on?\n\nMara knows.\n\nShe settles in for the long wait, entirely alone, almost at peace with it.","name":"Tyrannocide V","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":86503858,"index":554,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"86503857":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"I see.

She cycles through comms channels as she flies: The Hive are swarming the Outpost, and the Disciples are demanding escort in their evac. Devi is MIA.

Devi is found.\n\nPetra cannot turn off the radio. She cannot stop listening; she can scarcely breathe. She wants to reverse course and fly her ship into the eye of that flagship; she wants to wreck herself against its ugly scrimshawed hull and scream so clear and true as she dies that that wretched beast will hear her and know what atrocity he has committed. She wants to believe Mara is alive but how, how, how when she cannot feel her, when she does not know every step of the accursed plan!\n\nShe approaches Thieves' Landing from a reckless angle, then cuts fast and low across the lashed-together wreckage of the Shore. The air is thick with dust and debris and shimmering immaterial Harbinger matter; it is impossible to see more than a klick out.

Not very long ago, Processes and Services was the place Illyn and her sisters came to make the Desolates—items of technology imbued with the husk-dry power of Oryx's Taken. Illyn was the first to stand as living conduit; the first of the Techeuns to use that deep interior faultline, that fundamental Awoken schism, as a bridge. She remembers the endless, awful, infinitely malicious screams of the things. But she also remembers the whispers… and if the screams are silent now, the whispers are louder than ever.\n\n\"Quickly,\" Illyn hisses. \"Before Petra is informed.\" Any breach of Processes and Services triggers an alert, and while they were crafty in their intrusion, even minute body heat and motion of the air will be detected. \"We must ask our questions and go.\"\n\nBrave Portia leads them to the cell she selected for their use—a vacuum-gapped sphere of relic iron coated inside and out by signal-deadening spinfoil.

The stink of ozone rolls out.\n\nThere is a Taken Vandal within, flexing and shuddering through nameless permutations of blissful agony.\n\n\"Nascia,\" she whispers. Quiet, precise Nascia slips a whisker of cable into the port, guiding it through impossible twists and encrypted locks with the caress of her augments' fields.\n\nIllyn rubs her temples. The whispers are loud here. The whispers that haunt the place where their Queen's voice once sounded. Whispers which sound so much like missing Shuro Chi and the others from the Queen's flagship.\n\nThey should have selfgated to the Dreaming City if the battle went wrong. They should have come home safe. What if they need help? What if Petra has kept their fate from Illyn? Would she do that, Petra Covensdaughter, raised by the witches? Things have not been easy between the Regent-Commander and the Techeuns…\n\n\"Ready.\" Nascia offers the splayed end of the cable to them. \"Be careful, all of you.\"\n\nTheir augments sync in a stutter of light, like a sunbeam passing over a field of diamonds. Inquisitive Lissyl forms the first question. Do you hear us?\n\nThe viper-strike rush of the Taken thing's will comes at them. It is powerful, but familiar: Illyn deflects its demand. \"I think it hears us,\" she says, with a grim chuckle. \"We know Taken too well, don't we?\" There were fears once that the Guardians would be appalled by the Taken-empowered armor. But Petra was right. Guardians will wear anything that gives them power—whether tactical or social.\n\nTogether, they unfold the Taken thing's brutally elegant interior geometries, seeking the threads of connection that reach out across space and time. \"Shuro?\" Illyn whispers. \"We have heard you. Do you hear us?\"\n\nThat is when she makes the fatal mistake. She thinks of the time before Saturn. She thinks of Shuro Chi and Uldren and Mara. She… wants that time back.\n\nShe wants.\n\nIn the nonspace around them, great jaws snap shut.\n\n\"RIVEN!\" brave Portia screams.

But at this exact moment, a shard of cyanide-laced ice from the far reaches of the Oort cloud will penetrate the Reef's ravaged defenses and smash into Zavala with such velocity that he becomes a thin ooze across the floor, a scum.

It still kills her to hear Zavala speak openly of the Reef as a distraction. \"Cayde had a proposal,\" she says, \"that he wanted us both to hear.\"\n\n\"Yes I did!\" Cayde prances between them, like a flare meant to draw off the heat-seeking fury passing between Petra and Zavala. The City's fall drove him deep into his jester persona, devil-may-care and fancy free; he hasn't quite recovered. \"It's like this, Petra.

I want your permission to go through the debris swarm for materials and spaceframes. The dead will, of course, be returned.\"\n\nPetra is silent. Arach expects her, being a spacer, to be a pragmatist; to see that the Reef doesn't have the spare capacity to process this salvage and that the inner Solar System needs as many ships as it can raise. There is also the question of Oryx's weapon and whether it can be defeated if the Dreadnaught ever stirs again.\n\nBut Petra remains silent.\n\n\"The wounds are still too fresh? I apologize. It seems a shame to leave those resources for the Fallen, or to drift into Saturn…\"\n\nShe speaks. \"Earthborn. Did you mourn for her?\"\n\nHe thinks she will know if he lies. \"I respected her, yes, but I despised the way she seemed… entitled… to us all. I never regret choosing the path I did. I was Awoken to continue the search we started long ago. The quest for worlds worthy of our lives.\"\n\nPetra turns her back and goes.\n\nHe stares after her.

She refuses the choice.\n\nJalaal pities her a little.

We Earthborn feel your loss and hope this tragedy will usher in a new era. We have made great strides in unraveling a richer and deeper history of Earth and its colonies—a history buried below merely ordinary truths. This content is, of course, far too sensitive to publish generally. We long feared that if it were intercepted by her Majesty your Queen, it would be denied or manipulated to serve some need of her own. Some of these discoveries relate to the nature of our \"awakening,\" while others point to the occurrence of journeys like our own… journeys that may have had troubling results. All of this scholarship would benefit from cross-reference and critical comparison with your own collected records. We hope you agree that this knowledge is far more important than any schism that once defined our peoples.

That you would attempt to use our misfortune to solicit access to our vaults and records (which I assure you are far more extraordinary than whatever half-eaten corruptions you've discovered among your ruins) is quite appalling. We will, however, happily review any data or records you believe would be of interest to our efforts. You'll also be curious to know that reams of new discoveries are being generated daily since your Traveler cast out the last of its Light to refuel your Guardians. Let us hope you are wise enough to understand its message.\n\nWith all the respect that is due,\nMaster Ives","name":"Of Earth and the Reef","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":86503860,"index":560,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"86503867":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Zavala lowers his brow to the Ionian earth. It feels like the respectful thing to do. There's a big coiled ammonite fossil right under the thin topsoil, though, and he knocks his forehead on it. The pain and the blowing sulfur dust make him sneeze.\n\n\"Humbly I come,\" he says, almost laughing, \"to speak to thee.\" Ikora said this was the place. Io. A world still half-born, connected as if by an untorn umbilical to the Traveler. \"I wanted to say… thank you.\"\n\nHe finds he's looking up at Jupiter. He's accustomed to seeing the Traveler above the City, so he fastens on the nearest huge floating sphere as a proxy. He forces his eyes down to the soil again. \"Thank you for what you did to Ghaul.\"\n\nIkora tells him if you listen with the right ears, you can hear the Traveler's last conversation with Io. As if the matter of terraforming an entire moon with Earthlike gravity and a biosphere is only a matter of rhetoric and instruction. Well. Isn't that the challenge, in the end? Not just assembling the power to do something, but convincing people to do it? No, not even that—not convincing or coercing (Traveler knows he is tempted sometimes), but teaching them how to think as you think, how to value what you value, even giving them the ethics required to understand your valuation. So that you can trust them to make the choices you would, even when you're not around to father them.\n\nZavala wishes he were half as good a teacher as he is a Titan. Then maybe he could allow himself to relax a little and let others take care of things.\n\nExcept last time he let his guard down—last time he dared think they were triumphant, with Oryx repelled, SIVA contained, Vex befuddled, Cabal huddled in their bunkers and too stubborn to come out—Ghaul turned up in a storm and nearly destroyed the City, the Traveler, and everything Zavala loves.\n\n\"Did I fail you?\" he asks the bone-coiled dirt. \"Am I… the reason you had to wake up? Because I couldn't stop Ghaul by myself?\"\n\nIn the giddiness of victory, he declared this their new Golden Age. But now he thinks he may have misunderstood the Traveler's awakening. He has always, he hopes, been a brave man. But he is almost too afraid to ask this next question. \"Is this just our next 'age of triumph'? Is something worse on the way?\"\n\nThe bruise where he head-butted the fossil throbs. History, Zavala once told someone, is a question of armor. How much can you survive and keep on living? More than this, more than what's hit them so far.\n\nBut how much more? And if the next escalation is a consequence of the Traveler's awakening, will it be Zavala's fault?\n\nDuty is a puzzle. The harder you work, the more it seems to weigh. That reminds Zavala of Basho, his favorite poet, and of the hot spring Basho once visited to see the Murder Stone, which killed birds and insects that came too near. He has a horrible idea of the Traveler as that stone, surrounded by buzzing flies all shaped like Ghosts…\n\n\"You're doing it again,\" his Ghost warns him. \"I know that expression.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Zavala says. \"I just worry.\"","name":"Pilgrimage","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":86503867,"index":561,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"86503866":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Spider's lair.

Keratinized skin gives way to toughened callus, ugly with bruising and overstressed veins.\n\nHe spreads his palm against his chest and holds it there, as if covering it up will make it go away.

I am trying to chronicle trillions of star systems at once, searching for a single planet. A faceless companion asks why I look so sad, and I show her a photo of a globular mass or a dual-ringed planet, depending on how you hold it. \"How much did you pay for that?\" she asks. \"Everything I have,\" I respond. Then the stars stop streaking and the ship crumbles apart. We fall into nothing, and I awake.\n\nFISSURING WARMTH: I am running from an encroaching burn of blue light. I jump from rock to rock, as they are the only things with gravity. Every leap is a battle against the cold nothingness of space. I see a sea of people gathered together, and realize that's where I am trying to go. I make one more giant leap, but the blue burn catches my ankles, and I fall. The impact of my plummet shatters the rock in two. Hundreds of these beings fall into the chasm I created behind me. I try to heave each of them back to the surface, and I do until I can't anymore. My elbows won't bend; my arms are too weak to push. The descent gets warmer and warmer until all goes black, and I awake.\n\nSONGS OF ANALYSIS: I am outside my body watching it float from one shapeless void into another. The first void contains a voice humming a tune, yet no presence. As I pass through each, one by one, another voice joins in harmony. I try counting the voices, but I am not sure if I should be adding or subtracting as they fade into one, and in my confusion I lose any memory of numbers at all. I feel a tether pulling me back into being and see myself waving goodbye. A voice burrows into my mind as the serenading songs become discordant, ugly. The voice becomes louder, and I awake.\n\nWASHING SKIN: I have gathered my belongings in a gray porcelain sink. The soap clings to my fingers. As I wash what I possess, my things begin to dissolve. I scrub harder because I know that the washing is a way to remove impurity, and I must be certain that I will not dissolve too. My mother tells me that silver is the element of false-life, blue skin poison. I worry that my fingernails are soft.\n\nMOUNTAIN: I am on the mountain at Felwinter's Peak, except there is an express monorail to my neighborhood grocery in the City, which is all out of what I need. A Guardian brings me a special engram. I refuse to decrypt it.

Do you think they'll bypass us?\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" Dinna says, grimly. \"Not the littlest chance.\"\n\nThe Queen's Guard has, technically, never been defeated in battle: Pride dismisses the House of Wolves' backstab as an act of treachery, not military might. But once more the Fallen are loose in the Reef… and if there is no treachery involved, Dinna will eat dirt and call it hummus. This reminds her too much of that awful day.\n\nSo when the voice comes through the door, she calls, \"Hold. Hold.\"\n\n\"Paladin Dinna?\" the Prince of the Awoken calls. \"You know that's my throne you're guarding, don't you? May I come in?\"\n\n\"You're not alone,\" she shouts back.\n\n\"I have my retinue with me.\"\n\nA few of Dinna's people lower their weapons. \"Weapons up,\" she snaps. \"We can't trust him to—\"\n\nRoyal overrides slither through the throne room's networks.

Just a moment's weakness. Just the subtlest flicker of deference, because he is the Prince and it feels so right to have royalty in this throne room again. Fingers off triggers, weapons skewed a few degrees off target—\n\nThe impulse is so strong because it jives with Dinna's discipline, which has already stepped in to crush the immediate instinct to blow Uldren away. Something's wrong. Something's off.\n\nBaseline Humans can react to a visual stimulus in less than two hundred milliseconds. Awoken, less than a hundred. But there is a phenomenon Dinna and every other Royal Guard knows well, a trick of the mind called attentional blink. You are waiting for something to appear: a hostile, a gunshot, a loud noise. When it does appear, your attention blinks. You cannot detect a second event if it comes just after the first.\n\nSo it is with the blue flash of Arc-rifle fire behind Uldren's cloak.\n\nIt could go differently, still.

Not a man, woman, or child survived. Flushed with the high of easy victory, he and his followers were ill prepared for the Fallen war party that had been stalking them the last few moons.

Osiris and Ikora would talk for hours—days, sometimes—and frankly, it was pretty boring. Especially when I got stuck entertaining Ophiuchus. Seriously, that Ghost is not a conversationalist.\n\nAnyway, O said he had a theory why there was one Ghost for one Guardian. He thought that each of us had strengths that complemented weaknesses in our Guardian, and vice versa. That we needed to be together, or neither of us would be whole.\n\n\"Like soul mates?\" I asked. \"Because I'm not in love with Osiris or anything. Not only would that be really weird, he kinda gets on my nerves a lot of the time.\"\n\n\"It is not a romantic attachment,\" O said. If he had eyes, he would have rolled them at me. \"It is my belief that the Traveler understood that normal people would not be enough to protect humanity. That it would take those who are extraordinary in both body and spirit. And that only by the merging of Ghost and Guardian into a single unit could this be accomplished.\"\n\n\"I don't know where Ikora keeps you,\" I told him, \"but Osiris and I are not 'a single unit.' You've heard us argue. A lot.\"\n\n\"And why do you challenge him?\" O asked.\n\n\"Because no one else will. He's the great and powerful Osiris: hero, scholar, savior, yadda yadda. And no one, I mean no one, not even Ikora, really challenges him. They do what he wants, even if it's a terrible idea. Not me.\n\n\"Everyone needs someone to tell them to get over themselves once in a while. Especially Osiris.\"\n\n\"Would you say that is a strength that complements a weakness?\"\n\nI didn't answer. I hate it when someone else is right. Good thing it doesn't happen often.\n\n\"All right then, smarty Ghost,\" I finally said. \"What about you and Ikora? You're both rigid and stuffy, read too much…\"\n\n\"I am a calming influence. I encourage her to think before she acts and not to let her emotions get the best of her.\"\n\nI couldn't help it.

What is the magical heart of the process? Are we like the City's probability kilns, twisting the quantum vacuum in our favor to yield matter?\n\nPerhaps. Perhaps.

Where do you find that template?\n\n\"Simply in a neighboring timeline. A place where he is still alive and intact.

I let emotion get the better of me. The Fallen had moved on. The few survivors were huddled close in the dark of a cave, muffling their heavy, quick breaths, stifling their sobbing.\n\nWhen I found them, many nights before, I also found renewed purpose. I had traveled these dead and dying worlds for longer than I cared to remember, all the while in search of a spark worthy of ignition.\n\nOver time I'd grown weary, but in this small band of survivors, I found hope. If I couldn't find a lost soul worthy to be touched by the Light, then I would find another way, a smaller way, to be of service. I would lead this small gathering of desperate men, women, and a single child to the growing sanctuary beneath the Traveler.\n\nIf I could not find a hero to challenge the Darkness, I would be a guide to those in need of salvation.\n\nIt took some time to gain their trust. I was odd—other. They thought I was an angel. I told them I was not. They named me Tiānshǐ. I did not object.\n\nThe child marveled at me. Still too young to speak, much less comprehend, he had a presence that was a burden and a boon. His parents did all they could to nurture him, protect him with the aid, comfort, and care of their traveling companions—once strangers, now bound deeper than blood by their shared experience in this new life after the end of the world.\n\nOn that day, in that cave, huddled in fear as the Fallen Skiff's roar faded over the tree line, the mother wailed—a sound I had never before heard and hope never to hear again.\n\nSuch pain. Such sorrow.\n\nGrief. Suffering. Loss.\n\nHer cry echoed through the forest. Her husband, weeping and on the edge of breaking down, simply held her.\n\nAnd the dead child in her arms.\n\nThe others tried to calm them, out of fear that the Fallen would return. The attack had been swift and brutal. Twenty dead. Only nine survivors, here, in this cave. I watched the tree line, anxious and afraid.\n\nThe mother's pain filled the space between the thick trees. I turned back to her and saw it for the first time: the child's spark.\n\nFaint. But there.\n\nThis little boy was not my charge. Those selected to return were champions. This child was so small, so frail. What devotion had he shown? What bravery? What had he sacrificed? But a thought lingered…\n\nWas it not my purest purpose to deliver hope? Every hero raised fought not for themselves but for the whole of humanity. If saving one life—if redressing this one terrible loss—was not a worthy cause… what was?\n\nI watched the mother as she cried.\n\nI felt myself expand. Felt the Light that was me intensify. In a way, it was outside of my control, as if something had reached inside of me and flipped a switch. A beam erupted from my core and bathed with Light the child's small, broken body.\n\nA second passed—\n\nAnd he began to cry. All fell silent. The Traveler's gift had been given. A child, returned. And with him, the beginning of my journey's end.\n\nDid I do the right thing? Would the child grow to reach his peak physical self? Would he, like all returned, be ready for the wars to come?\n\nBut then a thought came over me, one I had never before considered: maybe death would have been better.\n\nHad I saved the child, or doomed him?\n\nAs his cries echoed, the survivors looked on in shock. There was joy in their silence—wonder.\n\nI looked down on him, and pride began to well inside of me.

Secrets are like weapons, and I am an instrument of their unmaking. They are enemy, they are cruel, and I will learn and share, and they will be undone.\n\nWhat is that shouting? I am deep now, no telling how far in. I have tracked each meter. Mapped every path. But this maze is ever-winding and their cheers now echo, violent with joy, and I hesitate to investigate as I am entering unknown corridors thick with security… Yes, yes, this is a special place, a holy place, a mechanized place, and the shouts merge with screams and the grinding of gears, and the joy joins with pain. There is suffering here, punishment—a, a… a ritual? I must know so we may know, and I move slow, careful… must… not… be seen… cannot be detected… Meter by meter, anywhere where cover is provided. Quick and with purpose whenever exposed. I make my way, leaving other avenues unexplored; the cheers must be understood. But eventually they die. Replaced by the harmony of the pirates' busy days and nights, oh my how they never rest—or rather… when they rest, others continue the work, prepping scavenger sorties, sifting through spoils, readying their fleet, their weapons, their worship. The manner in which they revere machines, I should feel safe here, I should be among their gods… Am I machine? I don't know, I don't know anything. Their worship is not so simple. With the cacophony of excitement no longer echoing, I slow my pace but remain vigilant in my efforts to locate its origin.\n\nIt is weeks before I do, weeks before now. A ceremony has just ended and I am sending out a recollection of what I have seen, because I am seen—these are my final moments, of this I am sure. The ceremony is combat, ritual, and fury, it is a pit and arena where the lesser and unworthy must prove their value or suffer and die. Oh how they fight dirty, oh how they fight to survive—or to thrive. In this pit, before the eyes of an Archon, shamed Eliksni may redeem themselves, lesser pirates may improve their station: a Dreg to a Vandal, a Vandal to a Captain, a Captain to… This is their forge, their place of judgment, their trial before their betters. This is what we are up against; kill or die, thrive or perish, they have no use for the weak and they watch and cheer and scream as their Archon looks on. But I have become careless. The fervor became a distraction and now the Archon's eyes have found me and I am too deep to run and I think he is smiling…\n\n—The last frantic transmissions of Wren, a brave Ghost of the spectral network","name":"From Fallen Ground","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4df20ace5764dfcf870238ca267466dc.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":220096391,"index":618,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"220096390":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The Ghost Community Theater presents:\n\nORYX THE NIGHTMARE DADDY:\nOne Brave Ghost Versus the Death from Outer Space\n\nA four-and-a-half-act play\nWritten and directed by Didi, Ghost of Marcus Ren\n\nSTARRING:\nMarcus Ren............................................Hero's Ghost\nDidi the Ghost.....................................Guardian Hero\nEnoch Bast...........................................................Oryx\nPixie, Ghost of Ariadne Gris............................Ir Halak\nSweeperbot.....................................................Ir Anûk\nGhost, Ghost of Enoch Bast....Ghostly Shade of Crota\n\nSee the play that Commander Zavala calls, \"An insensitive and disrespectful travesty of a production, with truly abominable prop design—an insult to the art of papier-mâché.\"\n\nThe eponymous Ghost himself calls it: \"Is this supposed to be me?

The Traveler is our primary, our mother, the primordial and the pinnacle. A dear friend, the Ghost of Pujari, once compared the Traveler to a song that has never been sung—\n\nPEACH: Look, the answer no one likes to give is that no one knows what the Traveler is or anything about it. Not even us.\n\nBALTHAZAR: We know she wished for us to raise Guardians to be her avatars and defenders—\n\nPEACH: Do we, though? Just because we CAN do that doesn't mean we were MADE to do that. And who says it's a \"she\" anyway? Why does \"it\" need a gender?\n\nBALTHAZAR: The Traveler, in her omniscient wisdom, looked into the past and the future, and from all the generations that emerged from the cradle of Earth, she chose the best of them to be her champions. Each Ghost was lovingly and carefully created for their one true Guardian. The Ghost and Guardian complete each other.\n\nPEACH: If that's true, then the Traveler's kind of a jerk.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Excuse me?\n\nPEACH: Look, I know tons of Ghosts who died before they ever found their Guardians. I know some Ghosts who still haven't found a Guardian. You haven't. And I haven't, but I don't think I'm \"incomplete\" because of it.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I have the humility to recognize my own shortcomings and to submit myself to the Traveler's plan.\n\n\nQ: Do you remember being inside the Traveler?\n\nPEACH: No.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I do. We call it the Womb.\n\nPEACH: I have never and will never call it that.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Imagine a cosmos inside a bottle. Trillions of stars orbiting each other in a complex weave. But they aren't stars. Perhaps a better word would be… souls. Souls, dancing in an infinite space enclosed within a celestial egg.\n\nPEACH: Which is it, an egg or a womb?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It's called a metaphor.\n\nPEACH: Well then, pick a metaphor. Not twelve.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Well, what would you call it?\n\nPEACH: I wouldn't call it anything, because I don't remember it, and I don't think you do either.\n\n\nQ: Some people say that each Ghost is an aspect of the Traveler—that is to say, that each Ghost represents a part of the divine Whole.\n\nPEACH: [loud laughter]\n\nBALTHAZAR: Would you please? This is unbecoming.\n\nPEACH: First of all, that wasn't a question. Second of all… [more laughter] Third of all: if I'm a part of the Traveler's brain or soul or whatever, then the Traveler sure isn't divine, I'll tell you that much.\n\n\nQ: What will you do if you never find a Guardian?\n\nBALTHAZAR: I shall find a Guardian. The Traveler has willed it so.\n\nPEACH: Did you get that in writing?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It is true that some Ghosts die before finding their partners. If that happens to me, then I suppose I will \"do\" nothing, since I will no longer be. But I have faith.\n\nPEACH: If I never find my Guardian, I'll go steal someone else's. I hear Sagira had a good time with that.\n\n\nQ: If you could eat, what would you eat first?\n\nPEACH: Finally, a good question!\n\nBALTHAZAR: We do not know the desire for food. Our semicorporeal form—\n\nPEACH: Nectarines. Or hot sauce. Ooh, or crickets. Crunchy roasted crickets. Crunchy food sounds so fun. I wish I could get cricket carapace stuck between my teeth. Here's a question for YOU: what's it like to have teeth?\n\nBALTHAZAR: Is this over yet?","name":"Difference of Opinion","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4df20ace5764dfcf870238ca267466dc.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":220096389,"index":620,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"220096388":{"displayProperties":{"description":"From: Micah-10\n\nTo: Tallulah Fairwind\n\nCategory: 5-sat bounce\n\nPriority: 3\n\nHello, old friend:\n\nI have a knack for finding Hunters. Another of my little pack has found her partner, a Human male, and now the two of them are coming to you by watercraft over the Pacific. Keep an eye on this one, Tallu. He has taken the name Andal Brask, and I believe he will be trouble.\n\nPerhaps all this travel has made me sentimental, for when one of my Ghost wards finds their Guardian, I am sad, because my pack grows smaller. I miss them when they are gone. Now I am down to one Ghost other than my own. Pup, we call him. The runt of my metallic litter. Pup has yet to speak, but always his little blue eye searches for his Guardian.\n\nI plan to resupply at the Cosmodrome and then take Pup north. Those steppes are uncharted territory, except by that lone wolf, Conar. My correspondence with him is regular in the outbound direction; I consider myself lucky when he answers every fifth message. Still, you and I both know his intel is good. No one else knows Old Russia like he does.\n\nPerhaps in the Cosmodrome I will find a ship capable of breaking atmosphere. Though there is much of this Earth I have yet to see, I have come across more than a few Ghosts who believe their Guardians are offworld, waiting in the Golden Age ruins of Freehold and Ishtar and beyond. Some of these little Lights have decided to brave the null on their own to reach their fated partners. I tell them there's still so much of Earth we've yet to sniff out, that perhaps their Guardians have not yet been born, but some of them are convinced. If my next Ghost pack wants to make the journey, I am determined to join them.\n\nThese last few months we've enjoyed the pleasant absence of Cyrell. Now I feel more confident that we lost him in Australis. If he tries to hurt my Ghosts, I will rip his throat out.\n\nI hope you're not feeling too cooped up. You're still doing good work, Tallu.

I don't know that it matters. I have been searching since the day that I was born. I will take anyone.\n\nI crest a dune. The Gobi is endless in the evening light. And then I see it: a burnt-out building, the only man-made structure for miles. I do not know whether to fly faster or keep a stately pace. It doesn't matter. The dead cannot see.\n\nI am nervous. Why am I nervous?\n\nAs I draw closer, I rehearse what I might say. First introductions are important. \"You are a child of the Traveler's Light,\" I say to myself. \"You have been chosen in defense of this solar system… No. No. Hm. You… We are both children of the Traveler. You and I are both children of…\"\n\nI forget my words as I slip into the building. I find meteorological equipment. I find an empty office. I find a dingy breakroom. At the back of the breakroom, I see my other half: a Fallen Vandal crushed beneath a toppled refrigerator.\n\nI am devastated. I have seen the Fallen. They are butchers. Castaway murderers. I would take anyone, but not this. Not this thing.\n\nI turn away. I count seventeen slow laps around the room and then another four around the building. I should be decisive, shouldn't I? I should be filled with pride that I have fulfilled my first purpose. I am not. It doesn't matter. I cannot ignore the pull.\n\nI return to the breakroom. I do not know what I will say, but—Fallen or no—it is the Traveler's will that I do this. I reach toward the Light, then reach toward that pull to join them together.\n\nThe refrigerator trembles as the Light suffuses him. I hear a low groan. \"Push it away,\" I whisper. If my Risen dies beneath this refrigerator and I fly away into the sun, no one will know. Perhaps I will have done the Earth a great service. \"I'm here with you, but you must help yourself. Push it away and sit up.\"\n\nThe refrigerator shifts, then topples to the side. An Awoken man sits up and pushes the dead Vandal off his chest like an unwelcome blanket on a hot summer night. With effort, he wiggles free and stands straight.\n\n\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asks. He looks around, then down at his blue hands. \"What am I?\"\n\n\"I am your Ghost,\" I say with more than a hint of obvious relief. \"You are one of the Traveler's Chosen, a defender of humanity. What is your name?\"\n\nHe flexes his fingers, works his jaw, blows a raspberry. Then he looks at me. \"Savin.

How does this have like three hundred comments?\" she says, flicking to the next page. \"Where's the juicy stuff?\"\n\n\"Hey, it's Pulled Pork,\" Agu says, peeking up over one of Nkechi's tremendous pauldrons.\n\nShe sits up right away, eyes lighting with interest. \"Really? Where?\"\n\nPulled Pork is the name they've given to a very sweet, very earnest Ghost that has been looking for his Guardian for about as long as they can remember. Pulled Pork is not his real name, but it feels right, like calling Mara Sov by her full name instead of just her forename.\n\nAgu directs Nkechi's attention out into the floating scrap. Sure enough, there he is: a tiny speck moving with meticulous patience across the surface of a blasted-out Fallen Skiff. \"Let's go say hi,\" Nkechi decides, disabling her VanNet HUD. She climbs to her feet and begins a lazy zero-gravity parkour run, leaping and drifting from one hunk of scrap to another.\n\n\"Hey, buddy!\" she calls when they get close. \"Whatcha doing?\"\n\nPulled Pork finishes up a scan of a floating piece of concrete and rebar, then turns toward them.\n\n\"I am looking for my Guardian!\" he chirps.\n\n\"That's nice. You gonna find him in that rock?\"\n\n\"You never know, Miss Nkechi Thirty-Two. Maybe my Guardian is very small.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Nkechi agrees. \"But you might want to consider scanning the dead, bud. That shell's pretty snappy. Is it new?\" It's Reef-purple, with a flowerlike silhouette and silver detailing.\n\n\"Yes! It is. It was a gift. And, thank you for your suggestion. I have considered it! I do often scan the dead. I also scan other things. I like to be thorough.\" Pulled Pork bobs in place politely, almost bowing. \"Please excuse me one moment!\" He turns to scan a piece of warped plasteel.\n\nThey watch. Nkechi shakes her head.\n\n\"Oh, leave him alone,\" Agu whispers in her ear. \"If he goes through every bit of scrap in the Reef, he'll find someone eventually. Sky knows there are plenty of bodies (and body parts) floating around here…\"\n\n\"Yeah, we said that when we found him on Mars, and that was before Twilight Gap,\" Nkechi replies.\n\n\"Well.

His quest was to become legend—to slay beasts and conqueror terrible lands. His quest was honorable… though, in the end, misguided. No, not in the end. Much sooner.\n\nThe flaw in his ambition became evident shortly after we crossed the western mire. At first I took his flights of fancy as playful enthusiasm—frivolous aggression free of consequence, a means of honing his focus and skill in advance of the dangers to come. But quickly, oh, so quickly, I found his mind was not in tune with reality. He was driven—pulled?—by his imagination.\n\nWhere any other would see the crippled ruins of an old-world crane—the snapped length of its long arm creaking in the breeze—he would see a demon, and in the cutting shrill of the swaying metal's cry he would hear a monster's ravenous shriek.\n\nHe had long talked of the adventures of his life past. \"I am an anomaly,\" he would decree, \"The lone Guardian whose past rings true, whose history is his guide.\"\n\nHe spoke about that dead life with such passion, in such detail, I not only wanted to believe… I did.\n\nBut as he charged the crane's age-poked carcass, I knew a truth that had haunted me since the carving of the Wicked Wood, some months gone: he was broken. His mind—unsettled. His truths—unfettered by fact, unbound by reality.\n\nHe had named the Wood, as he had the Howling Hills, the Dead Man's Crevasse, the Gorgon's Maze. All mundane landscapes marked as hazards to be conquered, enemies to be slain, as he weaved a mythic tale of his own grand—and as I would find, delusional—design.\n\nIn the Hills, he slaughtered wolves; he called them Hounds of Hell. In the Crevasse, he burned the remains of long-dead \"survivors\"; he called them Foot Soldiers of the Necro-King. Down in the Maze, he covered his tracks so that the Stone Mother would not—could not—follow.\n\nHe did all those things and none, because none of those things were true outside of his fraying mind. The wolves were simply rabid. The bones, no threat beyond a reminder of all we'd lost. The Maze? Just a canyon—one way in, one way out, a straight shot through.\n\nAs the crane fell and my Guardian issued his \"killing blow,\" he laughed and then turned to me. His eyes… I could see he was gone—the one I'd returned all those cycles past replaced by a hollow shell filled with madness.\n\nI do not know what broke him, or if he had ever been whole to begin with, but in that moment, as he spoke—the conquered husk of the Dragon of Summers' End, which wasn't really a dragon but simply a fragile old crane, lying defeated in his wake—I knew I would have to let him go… to end his slide into uncontrolled folly.\n\n\"Panza, old man,\" he started. \"The Dragon is gone, but he yielded his treasure to me in a whisper… A secret so dire it may just save us all.\" He leaned closer and said in a hushed voice, as if sharing a confidence, \"The Traveler is no gift—it is a lie… A beacon for death and destruction. Within be dragons, nurtured by our suffering, weaned on our hope. All dragons must die. The shell must be cracked till its yolk drowns those who worship its deceit. Our last great conquest. The crowning battle of our legend writ large.\" And then he shouted, \"For Light to endure, the Traveler must perish!\"\n\nHe was smiling. Confident.

Between the scattered remnants of the Red Legion and the Scorned Barons running rampant through the Reef, the Awoken had little left to call their own.\n\nThere was little left of the Awoken.\n\nVariks sighed. Only a true Kell understood that survival was not a game of waiting. And Petra Venj, for all her military prowess, was no Kell.\n\n\"In a world without Kells, Dreg strength will breed nothing but chaos.\" Variks whispered to himself the old Rain proverb, wishing for the return of the decisive days of his Queen. His Kell.\n\n\"What did you say?\" Petra asked without looking at him.\n\n\"Chaos,\" he replied. \"These Dregs breed chaos.\"\n\nPetra scoffed. \"They're Fallen. And where there's Fallen, there will inevitably be Guardians.\" She turned on her heel and walked away. \"I leave you to your Judgment, Variks.

Hers was a heart always in the right place… even if the outcome of her decisions was less than ideal. She did not, however, fully appreciate the threat these \"Scorned\" Barons posed. He had tried to warn her when they were just seven Dregs and a heretical Archon. Now their terror was spreading throughout the Reef with more and more Fallen answering the Barons' anarchistic call.\n\nShe was right about one thing though: He could stand to increase his intake. The thought of it made Variks thirsty for the flow. Like all of his kind since the appearance of the Red Legion, he had been forced to ration his intake. He'd never felt so weak, so close to death.

They began with the one thing their people needed to survive: Ether. In a way, the Barons had become heads of a new House, priests in their own rites, and arbiters of their own trials.\n\nThe terror they unleashed had almost grown as powerful as any Kell. These heathens were not Eliksni; they were more \"Fallen\" than any of their brethren. They were everything Judgment had sought to purge before the Whirlwind—and now, they sat rotting deep in the Prison of Elders.

Now he had doubt.\n\nHis goal had always ever been a simple one. The banner of House Judgment, the calling to which he had been born. Keep his people together.\n\nWith the Light now streaming across the system and nothing to show for it—no Queen, no Eris or Osiris, and no sign the Great Machine remembered the Eliksni—what was there to look forward to? Base survival. One day after the other. Living just because he still drew breath. And where was the Dreg strength in that? What was the…\n\n\"Variks.\" Petra burst through the comms. \"A Legion Harvester has been intercepted at bearing 189. Capture teams are inbound. Survivors for the arena.

He had but one ally left, after all.\n\nHe keyed the comms. \"Yes, yes, yes. Bay 41. Bring them in, will meet team. Will make room for new… guests.\" His vocal synth burbled, needing tuning.\n\n\"Copy that.\" She was gone.\n\nHe picked up his staff from where it leaned against the wall and began the long walk to the bay. Mulling his options, his information. His secrets.\n\nSecrets had protected the House of Judgment. The more knowledge one could obfuscate, the more significant one became. Secrets bred possibility. Secrets bred… sway.\n\nBut Judgment, true Judgment, required hierarchy. And Eliksni hierarchy died with the fall of the Houses. The Guardians had picked them apart, Kell by Kell, Prime by Prime. Now, there was all but nothing left of his culture—only pirates and scavengers and lone wolves like the days before the Edge Wars. No trust, no honor, no way to be… necessary.\n\nYet one final hope among the Eliksni still thrived. Craask, Kell of Kings. The Kings understood Judgment, for together they ended the Edge Wars in their people's golden age. Craask. His last hope to see his dreams of a united Eliksni made manifest. He must make contact.\n\nAnd so he hired a bounty hunter named Groks to find Craask and remind them of their need for one another. Groks is emblematic of all that Variks despises in his people—gluttonous, proud, and in it only for himself. When they spoke, Groks made Variks pay with a litany of insults.\n\nVariks the Slip. Variks the Beggar. Variks the Kell-Maker. But it was all for show. Groks would work; and it came for a mere four bales of Etheric Helix and a promise to keep him free of the Prison of Elders. The deal struck, Groks burst out in hysterical laughter.\n\n\"Ha! Consider job done, Slip!\" Groks spoke in a low form of Eliksni, the only reason Variks employed him. \"You have grown desperate with your 'Kell' gone. Have you not heard?\"\n\nVariks sighed.\n\n\"King Kell is gone, Kell-Maker. Dead at the hands of that insane Archon, Fikrul, and some Awoken vagabond he calls 'Father.' What remains of the Kings huddles now in the dead zones of Earth, under the shadow of the Great Machine's Shard. I expect my four bales in—\"\n\nVariks killed the feed. The last link in the great Eliksni chain was broken. If there were any who called themselves Kell out there, they would not know Variks, Judgment, or the laws that governed the Houses. The scattered children of the Whirlwind were dead.\n\nBut… Fikrul survived Cayde and his Six? Groks was a lot of things, but he was not a liar. If Fikrul was alive and strong enough to kill Craask… And who was this Awoken vagabond of which Groks spoke? His mind reeled. So long as Fikrul lived, the Reef was not safe. He scrambled through his comm channels, searching for the right connection.\n\n\"Master Cayde.

Shouts of victory and defeat reminded Variks of the worst of the Eliksni. His peoples' inherent need for superiority reduced to gambling for trinkets and gems.\n\nVariks searched the crowd, hunched down low. Just another Vandal. In the corner, the unmistakable crowd that surrounded the Hunter Vanguard when he was outside the City.\n\nHe worked his way through the onlookers to take up position alongside Cayde. The Hunter noticed him, he was sure, but said nothing. Variks, for his part, was silent. Watched as he lost a few thousand Glimmer and a sidearm to one of Spider's bodyguards.\n\nCayde spun a knife in his right hand and sighed dramatically. \"If we're going to talk, you're going to buy me a drink.\"\n\nThey found a quiet place at the end of the room. Cayde settled back in the booth. Waiting.\n\n\"You do great service to Reef, yes?\" Variks worked hard to keep his very recognizable voice down. It would be a shame for his vocal synth to malfunction and blare out across the room now. \"Capture Barons. Criminals. For Awoken.

Not unless you want to lose your last two real arms. We're done. Get. You're bad luck.\" The Hunter stood, made to leave. Variks reached out and grabbed the Vanguard by the arm with one of his mechanic hands.\n\n\"I am sorry. I spoke poorly. Please. Listen.\"\n\nCayde shrugged off the arm and stood, towering over the Fallen for once.\n\nVariks sat up straighter in the booth. \"Take me to Zavala.\" The Titan Vanguard's name was a punctuated, flowing stutter in his mouth. \"I have information. He will like what I say. You for bringing me to him.\"\n\nCayde blinked. \"You want me to take you to the City? No way, bug. Not in a million…\"\n\nWith a thud, Variks dropped the hand cannon he'd been hiding in his cloak on the table: a dull brown, bristles out the top, Ethertech trigger and muzzle assembly. Cayde's eyebrows went up in surprise.\n\n\"A gift of trust. Memento of the Reef. Upgraded, yes? Very deadly.\"\n\nThe Hunter Vanguard tried to hide his excitement. \"Is. Uh. Is that the last one? I haven't seen one of those in…\"\n\n\"One of the last. Not many left.\" Variks' voice was even, calm.\n\nCayde snatched the weapon from the table.

At the top of the maxsec wing, his hands flew over the controls. He prepared the two empty cells and ordered extraction Servitors into place, all the while reveling in the thought of the judgment of Fikrul.

Scattered about the floor was the evidence of its potency—as well as too many nights of failure: wrecked sentry Servitors, dozens of deflated Dregs, all pulled from the upper cellblocks to act as his \"assistants.\" Whatever this cold unnatural cocktail was that coursed through Fikrul, it could not be transferred or ingested like the Ether his people needed to sustain their wretched lives.\n\nVariks was all too ready to give up, send Fikrul into the arena to face Cayde-6, and put an end to the legacy of the Scorned Barons—until one day, during Variks's rounds, Uldren spoke to him unprompted. There was a lucidity in the discarded prince's eyes, a clarity that didn't exist even before he disappeared over Saturn's rings. Uldren gave Variks a… fresh perspective.\n\nAnd so, the chain. It was a dangerous gamble, mingling Fikrul's polluted lifeblood with traditional Ether. These Servitors held seventy percent of Variks's own Ether reserves. If this failed… well, it wouldn't be the first time Variks had risked everything and lost.\n\nVariks pulled the lever.\n\nThe hum of the Servitor chain crescendoed, but all he heard was the lingering echo of Uldren's poisonous question: Do you know where your true loyalty lies, Variks?\n\nBut if it worked—perhaps Fikrul could be cured. Perhaps—if what Variks suspected was true, and Fikrul's corruption was related to the Prince's affliction—Uldren could be cured, too.\n\nVariks had said as much to Petra, but she'd refused to listen.\n\n\"You will not experiment on the Prince.\"\n\n\"Our Prince is ill. To keep him here… hide him from Awoken eyes… not right. Not right.\"\n\n\"I've made my decision, Variks.\"\n\nVariks's fingers flexed. \"Petra, the Loyal,\" he sneered. \"Perhaps the murmurs of Kamala Rior are true, yes?\"\n\nPetra glowered. \"I will handle Uldren. You will not touch him.\"\n\nShe'd turned sharply on her heel and strode out. Variks hadn't seen her since.\n\nHe devoted all his time to the Servitor chain—and to his private thoughts.","name":"Chain of Souls","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/e506aade60239b0d08c743b7e6097da7.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3877778671,"index":639,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3877778670":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Variks's experiment succeeded, but not how he expected.\n\nIngestion of the Etheric concoction still resulted in Fallen death; it was not, by any means, a life-sustaining substance. It was, however, a life-GIVING substance. Though the dark Ether lingered like a heavy fog, it also seemed to reach out toward empty vessels. In this case, it found the dead Dregs that littered his floor. It slipped inside the corpses like a slow inhalation, inflating them, stretching them to the point of boils and bursting, pulling them to their feet. The dark Ether gave these lifeless Dregs… new life.\n\nThey seethed. Their breathing was steady, but hard and fast. They rumbled as if volcanoes lived inside their chests. A black fire rose from their skin as they burned this dark Ether like a jet engine burns its fuel. What Variks really saw before him was hate-fueled rage incarnate and the beginning of another Whirlwind. They were no longer just Fallen. Fikrul called them his Scorn.\n\nBehind him, Fikrul laughed and laughed and laughed until—he abruptly stopped. At that exact moment, the Scorn dropped to the floor, dead once more.\n\n\"Your scribes, your Kells, your Houses—they will all soon be forgotten, like the Elders and the Skaith before them,\" Fikrul growled in Variks's precious High Speak of Judgment. This drew Variks closer, face to face through the cell's porthole.\n\nFikrul turned his ear upward, listening. Brought his attention back to Variks. \"Father says…\" The pause hung heavy in the air. \"Father says… You know where your true loyalty lies.\"\n\nThe Fanatic stepped back from the porthole and waited.\n\nLoyalty. True loyalty.\n\nHe expected a memory of Mara to appear in his mind. But instead—\n\nInstead he found himself thinking about the prophecies of House Rain.\n\nKell of Kells.\n\nDays later, Variks performed his duties for the last time. He visited central control. Ran a test sim on the security systems, made some adjustments based on the results. Revised and signed off on the daily roster rotations. Finally, he had a private conversation with the prison's sole remaining High Servitor: The Prison of Elders would not go without a warden.\n\nHe did not speak to Petra.\n\nBy the end of that day, the Prison of Elders descended into chaos.\n\n\"Your time WILL come, Variks.\"\n\nUldren sits in his favorite spot, gazing in his favorite direction. \"She told me so. She has but one last wish of you.\"\n\n\"No, your grace.\" Variks' voice was gravelly with emotion. \"It is I who has one last service for you.\"\n\nVariks left before he could change his mind.\n\nA klaxon blared. The voice of the prison's High Servitor echoed over the loudspeakers—in Variks's voice. \"Security systems malfunction. Emergency shutdown and reboot commencing.\"\n\nThe place dropped momentarily into darkness, but emergency lighting quickly illuminated the cellblock. All around him, alarms sounded, warning lights flashed, pneumatics hissed, and cryogenic fluids evaporated to fog as the cryo-cells lining this cellblock began to open.\n\nVariks moved as quickly as he could toward the exit, not bothering to look back, for he knew what he'd see.\n\nThe Scorned Barons and Prince Uldren were free.\n\nAs was every single resident of the Prison of Elders.\n\nVariks slipped out, under cover of prison anarchy, through the same secret passage in which Petra and Cayde had smuggled Prince Uldren. There, a ship waited, loaded with the Prison's Ether stores.\n\nAs he walked, he made two recordings to be sent out by the Prison's relays once he was away. For the first, he disabled his voice synth and began, in the deep resonance of High Speak, to give commands.\n\nHe didn't know how many would answer Judgment's call. But he had to try.\n\nFor the second, he turned his voice synth back on. \"They call me betrayer. I who was most loyal. They do not think I hear the words. Bug. Insect.\" He paused. \"Fallen.\"\n\nUp, long strides, fast now, along the ramp into the ship. Toward the bridge. A vandal in Wolf colors saluted him as he passed.\n\n\"I hear the words. House of Judgement always hears. No choice. To keep the Houses together.\" He paused again, as he reached the bridge of his ship. \"Judgment always hears.\"\n\n\"The Great Machine stood in Judgment. Eliksni fell to fighting. Fell to hate.\" Emotion caught in his voice. \"Cannot stomach this hate.\" As he spoke, the ship's engines rumbled to life. On the screens, Variks could see explosions resonating through the Prison. His former charges running rampant. His ship passed through the bay's barrier and began to move off.\n\n\"Nowhere else to go. No one else to be, here.\" He drew himself up to his full height. \"And so I become Variks, the Kell. House Judgment envoy to the Eliksni people.\"\n\n\"No choice.\" He repeated, chuckling deep in his throat. His voice was calm. \"Eliksni must rise… yes?\"","name":"Where Loyalty

Awoken and Human Guardians remember nothing, so they just pick new names.\n\nSo I asked them why they chose theirs. Therin puffed out his chest—his armor looked like it had once been really fancy, but it was scuffed and dirty from the road—and said, \"Because it sounds awesome! Remember the name Therin Vai—it's the name of the Guardian who will find the lost Warmind Rasputin!\"\n\nWhen he said that, Lee-4 managed to look exhausted, which is impressive for an Exo.\n\nTherin talked about Rasputin and the Baikonur for a while, so to sidetrack him I asked Nadiya where her name came from. But she just rolled her eyes. \"I don't think Micah's paying me to chitchat.\"\n\n\"You're getting paid?\" Therin said.\n\nLee-4 elbowed him hard.\n\n\"Ow! What was that for?\"\n\n\"To remind you why we're here,\" said Lee-4. It was practically the first thing I'd heard her say.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" I asked.\n\nShe fixed her electric eyes on me. \"Old debts.\"\n\n\"To Micah?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nNadiya slouched against the tallwalk parapet, her head flung back to hang over the side. I thought about pushing her over. \"Good luck with that, whatever that means,\" said Nadiya. \"I'm all about new debts. Preferably other people's debts to me.\"\n\nJust then Lee-4 swung the sniper rifle off her shoulder so fast it almost cracked Nadiya in the head. Lee-4 fitted the scope to her eye and held the weapon perfectly still, without even leaning the barrel against the wall. A pause filled only by Nadiya's complaints—and then Lee fired off a shot.\n\nOn the horizon I saw a shadow fall.\n\n\"Fallen?\" said Therin.\n\n\"Kings,\" Lee confirmed.","name":"The Sixth Coyote","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"You wanna use your old name, that's fine by me.

But when they took my Ghost… Ooh, when they took my Ghost from me—that was the moment their lives ended.\n\nThey just didn't know it yet.\n\nSince my first rez, I kept to myself. Figured I'd always been that way, in my previous life and all. Joining fireteams, raiding, the Commander's Nightfalls—never my bag. Always walked alone. Never needed nobody. Except for Ghost. Ghost was my only friend. Got no shame in admitting that, not anymore.\n\nNot long after the Taken War, we'd made our way to the EDZ, looking for a place to call our own. Looking for some quiet. Maybe something resembling peace. Ghost and me, we'd been fighting since the Faction Wars. Always fighting. Non-stop fighting. And I was done. We were done. We'd been running solo ops so long, I don't think anyone even noticed we were gone. And we were glad for it.\n\nOur sudden disconnect from the Light changed all that. Like it or not, I was Guardian, he was a Ghost. Peace was never in the cards; the Traveler saw to that. Ghost reconnected to the City networks for the first time in I don't know how long only to find that comms were jammed planet-wide. So we moved west—to our original LZ, to head back to the City, to find the next fight. That's when they found us. The Cabal—Red Legion, we would later learn.\n\nThey marched us north of the Winding Cove. Set up camp within sight of the Shard. They ingested their libations. Got rowdy. They knew we were Lightless; they wanted to see what I was really made of, when I was just meat and air. I said, do your worst. And they did. Beat me within an inch of my final life and then guffawed when Ghost couldn't do anything to get me back on my feet. They ingested more of their bevvies, and one of 'em decided I had one eye too many, and he took it and popped it and laughed some more and asked me what I was gonna do about it. I laughed back, louder and crazier than they liked, and told them I had another. Then one of them, the worst one of them, took hold of Ghost, and said, I'm your Ghost now—I'm the one who decides if you live or die. Ghost was just a pebble in its meat hooks. And with no effort at all, Ghost was in pieces. Before the sun rose, they threw me off a cliff. They should have put a bullet in me. They should have fed me to their War Beasts.\n\nFigure Ghost chose me because I was some kind of hero in my before time. Maybe.

There was no burden he could not bear. That's what they said. He nodded and waved away the adulations.

First it was a Skiff. Then another, followed immediately by a third. And finally, a full-blown Ketch de-cloaked above their position. There were but three of them to protect a hundred who had once been thrice that. Within minutes, it was only her.\n\nShe corralled the survivors into a cave that once upon a time wasn't a cave but more of an industrial drainage system. It was foul here; the radiation was practically palpable, and the survivors—if they survived this day—would likely find their lives shortened by years if not decades thanks to this poisoned solace.\n\nShe pushed them forward, deeper into the underground, as fast as they could manage. She carried two children, both eerily silent and unaffected. They, like their people, had endured more than she could imagine in their five-thousand kilometer exodus. They had given up their homes for the promise of something better. For the promise of hope and light and the strength of the pack. In their quest for better lives, they had lost almost everything.\n\nHer Ghost told her the bad news—this cave system was a labyrinth extending dozens of kilometers with more dead-ends than not. The walls were deeply reinforced, and its scans could see but half a kilometer at best. It was going to be trial and error, and their pursuers were getting closer. Her Ghost didn't think they would make it. Not before…\n\nOne of the children in her arms—a little girl whose name was Violet—looked her in the eye and told her, without a hint of doubt, that she knew her Guardian would let nothing happen to them. Not after how far they'd come. She smiled at Violet and told her, yes, everything was going to be okay.\n\nShe set the children down, told them to run ahead and join the others; she would be right behind them. Alone with her Ghost, she told it to lead them to safety. She would stay behind and buy them time. And by the Traveler's Light, it would be an eternity's worth.\n\nAnd so, reluctantly, her Ghost floated ahead to rejoin the exodus, but not before swearing it would come back to find her and bring her back, no matter how long it took.\n\nWith the light of her Ghost now out of sight and the soft wet steps of a hundred refugees out of ear-shot, she strapped on her helmet, tightened her gauntlets, and drew a line in the muck beneath her feet. When the chittering of Fallen Dregs finally began to echo through the tunnels, she reached for the Light and with it crafted a shield of Void energy.\n\nIf need be, she would hold this line until the end of time.","name":"Ursa Furiosa","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"Stay back.

We were raving psychos at this point. Only the four of us and the howling wind and icy slopes for company. The occasional scurrying, vacuous creature to argue about.\n\nOne day, when we had settled in for the night in another monolith, something swept over the planet. I later learned it swept across the system. All'a you hearing this felt it. You were there at the source.\n\nAll four of us lost our Light. And we knew it. We looked over at the monolith-creature in its frozen cage. It seemed to stare right back.\n\nI think I mentioned we're all raving psychos at this point. Well, we did what all measured raving psychos would do. We thought we each had been betrayed by the others. We drew on each other.\n\nTo this day, I'm not sure how many of those guys drew intending to kill.\n\nBut I'll tell you this. I was the only one who walked out.\n\nThe creature in that monolith watched it all. When it was over, I stuck a finger straight up at it.\n\nIt was just me now.\n\nHow'd I get from there to here? Maybe I'll get to tell that story someday. We'll see if my Gambit makes it that far.\n\n—Drifter's thoughts recited to his Ghost, for posterity.

He quickly discerned the two on the field with the best athletic potential. Two Human girls, snarling as they swung branches at each other, seemingly impervious to pain. He walked past them, through the crowd, and several elders paused just briefly enough in their youth wrangling to let their jaws hang. Lord Shaxx navigated the unruly sea with grace, and headed toward a lone tree in a corner of the field. An Awoken girl and a Human boy sat huddled below it.\n\nAs Shaxx's shadow eclipsed them, they looked up at him with the same brightness in their eyes. \"What are your names?\" he demanded. \"Runa,\" said the Awoken with some disdain. She returned the blank stare of Shaxx's faceplate. \"My name is Lonwabo,\" recited the Human, more like a question than a statement.\n\n\"You look bored, Runa,\" Shaxx observed. \"And you look worried, Lonwabo.\" He pointed at the boy, who scooted back, startled.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned that makes both of you more intelligent than all these other dregs,\" said the Titan. \"You're with me. I need the rules of engagement.\" Shaxx stared at them, and they stared back. \"Someone talk to me.\"\n\nThey both spoke at once, and Shaxx listened in silence as they talked over each other to explain the game: Teams of two launch orb projectiles at each other, and players struck are eliminated. If both players on a team are eliminated, the team is out of the tournament, and their chance to play on the field is over.\n\n\"What do you call this drill? Skirmish?

Fight for those poor fools.\"\n\nLonwabo opened his mouth as if to speak, but hiccupped instead.\n\nShaxx turned them both around to face the sun and the other team across the field. He kneeled so low that his face was level with theirs. The three stared at the opposition: two Human boys, eyes glaring, fists balled in determination. Their elder stood behind them, her eyes wide as she recognized Lord Shaxx.\n\nRuna yawned and rubbed her face, trying to clear the sleep from it.\n\nShaxx whispered to his new charges. \"Crush them.\"","name":"Wing Contender","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"The double-headed phoenix that fights itself represents Guardians who strengthen each other in the Crucible.","hash":1069887756,"index":847,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"185853176":{"displayProperties":{"description":"A CRUCIBLE STORY\nPART ONE OF THREE\n\n\"I beat you fair,\" Cayde said. \"Don't ever—\"\n\nHe raised his hand high to wag a finger under Shaxx's nose.\n\n\"—try to outrace my Golden Guns.\"\n\nTwo children ran by in a blur, laughing.\n\nShaxx shook his head slowly. \"It was a tactical error.

The girls lifted an unrefined mass of plasteel, a makeshift trophy, over their heads, and they roared.\n\nShaxx stared up at the Traveler. It sat, buoyed by a mantle of clouds against a blue sky. It didn't seem to notice him.\n\n\"Tell me what you've learned,\" Shaxx said to Runa and Lonwabo, his faceplate fixed skyward.\n\nThey did, and spoke for a continuous three minutes.

The three of them looked on as the two girls smashed the plasteel cluster into the dirt, and to the horror of all the other children, it shattered.

Tess sighed. \"He can make the Hive quake in fear, but that man shouldn't be let within 10 meters of a designer's table.\"\n\nThe two women were still laughing when a shudder rocked the Tower. They turned as one in the direction of the far-off sound that followed—a roaring noise neither of them had heard before.\n\nThe PA blared in the small utility room they'd claimed as a lounge. \"Evacuation order 77 is in effect. This is not a drill. All civilians report to designated evacuation areas immediately.\"\n\nTess was at the door, palming it open when another explosion—much closer—shook them where they stood. Smoke and screams floated down the hallway.\n\nEva's memories of what followed were disjointed. She was running with Tess, gasping for breath. She remembered murmuring the names of her cousins, worrying about them down in the City. She was in a large crowd now, Tess was falling behind as Eva was crushed forward.\n\nAnother explosion, and a fire door slammed shut. Tess was gone, and Eva found herself with about 30 people in a small cargo bay between Tower North and the Hall of Guardians. A man was trying the far door, shouting that it was sealed.\n\nThen the roof came down as a large sphere crashed to the decks. Cabal clambered from the pod, struggling against their bulky armor as they began to fire at the civilians.\n\nThat's when a dazzling blast of energy took them from behind. The shouting was enough for ten men, but when Eva could see again, only one massive Guardian was there, ending a Cabal soldier with a blade as long as she was tall.\n\nThe helmeted face of Lord Shaxx turned this way and that, taking in the room. Two quick strides brought him to her side, and with a surprising gentleness, he helped Eva to her feet.\n\n\"Madam.\" He intoned, and she could feel the bass of his voice in her chest. \"I need your help.\"\n\nAt his insistence, she took charge of the civilians as he took point for their little group. With the confidence and looming presence of the Crucible master at her back, it was effortless to keep the others quiet and focused. When they reached an evac site, a trio of anxious-looking Hawk pilots waited with their craft.\n\nAs the last of the group climbed aboard, Shaxx laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. He towered over her as he said, simply, \"Comrade.\" And then he was gone, back toward the fighting, his massive sword slung over his shoulder.

They looked back in her direction, anxious. \"Can you fire a weapon?\"\n\nHer helpless look must have been an answer, because they reached out for the comms unit. She slid it across the floor, and they quickly punched in a sequence of codes. Another blast nearby caused the other civilians in the room to whimper and moan with fear.\n\nThe Exo barked into the unit. \"We need Guardian support, corner of the 1400 block Anchor District! I have a large number of civilians here, and our position is being overwhelmed!\" They punctuated their transmission by leaning out and firing off another half dozen shots. The Cabal roared back in animal fury.\n\nIt wasn't more than two minutes before Eva heard it: the distinctive sound of a Sparrow, running full-out. She dared to gather herself into a half crouch and peer out of the building. She was watching just in time to see a pair of them, a Hunter and a Warlock, descend on the invaders like vengeful angels. These two were professionals, she could tell—no swagger to them. They were efficient and deadly, and the soldiers began to fall back.\n\nSomething happened. Eva couldn't see what it was, but both of the Guardians reeled. The Warlock dropped to one knee, like his strings had been cut. The Hunter shook her head and raised a hand in the air, a distinctive signal, calling for the Light… but nothing happened.\n\nThe Cabal, like they'd been waiting for this moment, struck hard. The Hunter was bowled over by a charging Centurion and crushed underfoot. The Warlock didn't seem to ever really recover, and he fell to the ground, riddled by the weapon fire of a dozen soldiers.\n\nThe Exo was standing fully upright now, shocked, and even as Eva opened her mouth to tell them to get down, they fell—a sniper's target.\n\nOne of the men retched in the corner, horrified. Eva gave herself no time to think. She snatched the comm unit from the ground and pushed past the civilians to a far window. She used the reinforced case to smash out the glass and began hoisting children through once the largest shards were cleared of the frame. She was the last out of the building, and a few stray bullets plucked at the wall near her as she made her escape.\n\nThey didn't stop running until they were sure no one was following. She had no idea which district they were in, no clue even what the building used to be. Much of the orderly streets and well-tended boulevards she knew had become a maze of debris—the last safe City, a maze of collapsed and ruined structures.\n\nThe children were huddled up in a great pile as the older folk talked quietly among themselves. Everyone was crying, on and off, but they tried desperately to keep it quiet. \n\nA high-pitched chirp across the comm unit startled Eva, and she slammed her head back against the wall behind her.

Her mother would have died all over again of shock. \"We have to keep moving, we have to keep them with us, and we have to hold out. Whatever this is, it's temporary.\"\n\nHe grimaced, but she pressed on. \"When they regain the Light they'll…\"\n\nHer diatribe was cut short by a blast of static on the comm unit, so loud she dropped it on the floor. The reinforced case took the blow, and so everyone around clearly heard the deep voice of Commander Zavala when he began to speak. \"Citizens of the Last City. Hear my words.\"\n\nLike a people dying of thirst, the civilians moved in to circle the comm unit. Zavala had been a pillar, a beacon of hope all their lives. Surely he would…\n\n\"We are abandoning the City. We have evacuated everyone we could, but the Cabal now hunt Guardians in the streets. If you are able, you should make for the wilds.\" Eva felt as if she'd been physically struck.\n\n\"The Cabal have affixed a device to the Traveler and severed our connection to the Light. We cannot hold the City, and we cannot protect you.\" There was a long pause, as if he was weighing his words carefully. When he spoke again, Zavala sounded very, very tired.\n\n\"We are setting a rally point elsewhere in the system—watch for a broadcast. We will return to the City someday, but… I do not know when.\" Another pause. \"Be safe. Be brave.\" And he was gone.\n\nTo their credit, the group did not yell or shout. Even though it had only been a matter of hours, they were all alive because they'd learned not to give away their position. They did cry, though. Tears streaked trails down faces covered in ash; those faces looked from one to another as they sought to understand, to comprehend.\n\nEva did not cry. As she stared at the comms unit, all she could think about were Zavala's shoulders. She'd often joked with him about the size of the pauldrons on his armor, that massive protective plate on his left shoulder. And now… for some reason, she thought she understood. The weight on his shoulders…\n\nEva stood, and all eyes turned to her. She flinched a little. Then, choosing her words carefully: \"Most of them are leaving. So we have to help them.\" She gestured at the Guardians. \"If we can keep them alive, they can protect us, keep us safe.\" She looked around the group, found people nodding.\n\n\"Where do we go?\" one woman asked.\n\nEva looked back down at the comms unit. \"The Cabal will have heard that. They'll be watching the walls, expecting us to try to leave.\" She looked up, out at the room. \"So we stay here. We make for the edge of the City and try to find somewhere the Cabal won't expect us to be.\"\n\nThe seamstress reached down and pulled up the comms unit, slinging it over her shoulder. \"Everybody up. It's a long way to Twilight Gap.\"","name":"Hiding at Home","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075525,"index":854,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075522":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Just getting to the outskirts of the City was an ordeal. Every day, they saw the Cabal's control tightening. Civilian groups or the odd Guardian tried make a break for it only to be brought down by a swarm of ships hungry for a kill. The streets were no safer, with patrols moving in tandem and tanks rumbling through district centers.\n\nYears of supporting the Guardians, of listening to their idle chatter, had filled Eva's head with details about these horrific invaders. She realized they were doing rigid block-by-block sweeps, unimaginative and plodding. Just as described at the Tower.\n\nTheir group hid and observed and moved only when the Cabal did. In that careful manner, they arrived at the far reaches of the City—parts long abandoned, where Humanity was just a shadow cast upon the walls.\n\nEva found herself in consultation every day, organizing foraging patrols back toward the center. Evenings were spent suggesting strategies for the upcoming days.\n\nAnd to her great satisfaction, she spent nights sitting with a needle and thread, trying to make sure the survivors would stay warm on the move.\n\nAs the three Guardians recovered (they lost the Titan on the way to the Gap), they started offering more guidance. At their suggestion, the survivors never stayed in the same place more than a day or two. They posted lookouts every night and turned on the comms unit only every other day to listen for broadcasts. For chance transmissions. For hope.\n\nEva was there in the room when the Guardians heard Zavala's voice—his short, terse statement played over and over. \"If there is any Light left in the system… we rally on Titan.\"\n\nShe shut the door so the other civilians wouldn't hear and listened as they had it out. The other Warlock, Tam, identified herself as Trinh's sister. They were adamant that they try—somehow—to get offworld and head for Titan. The Hunter, Ramos, was just as adamant they stay.\n\nTheir discussion wound down and came to a slow stop with all three Guardians looking at her. She held up her hands and said, \"I trust you all to do the right thing.\" They stayed. And quickly became integral to the success of their… operation.\n\nWhat had begun as simple survival became an organized effort to evacuate civilians from the Last City. Foraging parties inevitably came back with more people than they left. Scouting parties probed the edges of the City and found avenues of escape, places where the Cabal were lax in their patrols.\n\nEva found that the same skills she'd used to plan holidays at the Tower were invaluable in organizing this underground movement. She cobbled together boards from old classrooms to create a schedule and wrote on the backs of old forms and newsletters to make \"delivery packages\" of civilians and the occasional Lightless Guardian.\n\nDay in, day out, this became her quiet routine. She faded into the background of the Underground: plan, move, sew, repeat. Even when contact was finally made with the Farm and getting survivors to the EDZ became the goal, Eva was always there making sure the trains ran on time.\n\nAfter some thought, she asked that her role not be spread around. She got word to people like Tess that she was alive, and that was enough for her. She had the chance to get out of the City dozens of times.\n\nBut every time she thought she'd take that exit, go with that convoy, she stopped herself. Settled back. Did the work.\n\nThat was how the months of the Red War passed for Eva Levante.","name":"The New Normal","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075522,"index":855,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075523":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"Abuela? Ma'am?\"\n\nIt was quiet, almost a whisper, but enough to wake Eva. For a spinning, disorienting moment, she thought she was sitting in her living room back in Peregrine district. Her favorite afghan over the end of the couch and Carlos standing over her… but that wasn't Carlos.\n\nThe concerned face of the Hunter, Ramos, looked down at her. More than a few of the Guardians that went through the Underground had taken to calling her grandmother, but Ramos had stuck with the group through all the long months of the war.\n\nHe was very protective, sometimes smothering, and she sighed as she rubbed at her eyes. \"I'm up. I'm up. What time is it?\" She sat up on the old couch she'd been sleeping on, wincing as she tried to sort the knots she'd developed sleeping on her side.\n\n\"Almost 0700?\" His voice was low and a little sheepish.\n\nShe glared at him. \"You were supposed to wake me an hour ago.\"\n\nHis grin was lopsided. \"You needed the sleep.\"\n\nShe stood carefully and tottered on unsteady legs, turning her face away so he couldn't see her annoyance. \"Are they waiting?\"\n\n\"They've only just arrived. One of the reasons I waited. They're not expecting you for another 10 minutes.\" Trying to justify himself.\n\nEva sighed again. \"Thank you, Ramos. You're right; I did need the sleep. I was up again too late last night. Go tell them I'll be right down.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\" He sounded happier, and his footfalls as he left the room were light, confident.\n\nEva stepped into the bathroom off the main living quarters of this second-floor flat. Her morning routine sorted, she poured some water out of one of the ration canisters into the stoppered-up sink so she could wash, try to feel a little less like she'd slept on a half-rotten couch in an abandoned building.\n\nWater dripping down her nose, she reached blindly for one of the pieces of scrap cloth they used for towels and dried her face. When her eyes cleared, she found herself looking at a stranger.\n\nEva had always been on the thin side. She could still remember her mother chiding her, telling her to eat and clean her plate. Now the woman staring back at her was positively gaunt. Bags under her eyes, hair chopped brutally short, and her clothes! The clothes she'd been wearing the day of the attack hadn't lasted two weeks, never intended for living rough. The homespun outfit she'd stitched for herself would never have passed muster back at the Tower, but… out here they had to do. At least she'd been able to salvage her trademark shawl. Something to remind her of better days…\n\nAs she drifted into the living room, Eva reflected that better days, of course, were why the group was gathered downstairs. All of the Underground cell leaders gathered in one place for an important—perhaps final—conversation.\n\nFor the Underground, the Red War was a stunning victory. They'd won. The only civilians and Guardians left in the City were those unwilling or unable to go. Eva frowned, saddened.\n\nEvery few weeks they heard stories of a group of Guardians overrun from a supposedly secure bunker by a Legion assault. The loss of civilian life had been staggering, both in the initial assault and the intervening months.\n\nAs she looked down into the street through a slit around the boarded-up window, she had to admit to a feeling of… satisfaction. Now all that was left was for the Underground itself to pull out, make for the Farm and the safety-in-numbers of Hawthorne's group. Eva raised her eyes from the empty streets to the distant sight of the Tower, twisted and ruined.\n\nShe would stay, she had decided. Guardians like Ramos could check on her from time to time, but someone needed to stay behind and keep the lights on. There could be refugees still alive out there. Still hoping for a way… out.\n\nShe turned away from the window to head downstairs when the explosion ripped through the street in front of the apartment, and Eva's world turned white.","name":"The Good Fight","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075523,"index":856,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075520":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Eva, for the second time in as many minutes, shook her head and tried to understand where she was. There had been no warning. She'd heard a few seconds of a whining engine overhead, and then a massive explosion ripped through the street in front of the Underground apartment.\n\nThe blast had thrown her to the ground like a doll. Everything hurt, and from somewhere close by she could hear the guttural shouting of Cabal soldiers. The distinctive sound of Guardian weapon fire was answering. Someone was screaming.\n\nWithout thinking, she was on her feet, lurching toward the far corner where her shotgun lay on a side table. Three steps, four, weapon in hand and checked. Just in time as the apartment door flew open and a pair of Psions stepped through, weapons ready.\n\nEva Levante, seamstress of the Tower, would have been taken aback. The gaunt woman she'd just seen in the mirror had spent months dry firing the weapon. Endless drills had trained her for action and her first shot took the one on the right in the chest and blew him out of the room. It had not prepared her for the kickback, however, and she felt something crack in her arm as the weapon bucked against her.\n\nThat flinch saved her life as she unwittingly pivoted to the side, narrowly avoiding shots from the other Cabal creature. Roaring, she raised the weapon against and her answering blast threw him against the far wall.\n\nBreathing heavily, she reloaded the weapon with one hand and waited, listening. No more outside that she could hear. Fighting was fierce downstairs. They needed her. She stepped to the door, weapon outstretched…\n\nThe sound of the wardog bursting through the apartment window was like another explosion. Eva whirled around as the scaly beast scuttled to the side, and another pair threw themselves from the hovering troop transport into the small living space. They landed with surprising grace, and three sets of hungry eyes stared at the seamstress. Drool smeared the floor as three sets of fanged mouths worked, eagerly.\n\nEva fired.\n\nThe beasts charged.","name":"Last Day","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075520,"index":857,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075521":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Eva Levante stood leaning against the ivy-covered outer wall of the barn, gazing down into the football field at the Farm. The old nets were slack, now. Needed to be rehung. No one came by who cared enough to restring them, and the Farm's current inhabitants were not the sporty type.\n\nBeyond the field were the rolling hills of the European Dead Zone, and on the horizon the twisted, ruined spur that was the Shard of the Traveler. Her first days back on her feet, recovering from the attack at the apartment, she'd stared in wonder at that view. \n\nNow she watched the clouds idly roil and collect around the Shard, bored. Eva smiled, and shifted her weight off the wall and onto the carved cane that kept her upright. To think after everything that had happened, she could be bored.\n\nHer first days at the Farm had been a whirlwind of medical treatments, rushed through by attendants already on their way out as she was coming in. It had been the final days of the Red War, a major operation planned to retake the City.\n\nOne old woman coming in from the Underground was a low priority, and in the commotion even the old friends she'd hoped to see had missed her.\n\nNow, she was alone. Or, mostly alone. She turned her head to see the Cryptarch, Tyra Karn, chattering away with Farm's postal frame. With primary operations returned to the City, Darbi had become Tyra's unofficial research assistant. Together they continued to study and examine Humanity's history through the lens of the Dead Zone, a sideline from the turmoil at the Tower Tyra was apparently only too happy to claim.\n\nThe scout, Devrim, came by every once in a while for a chat as well. When he was feeling cheeky, he referring to their little group as the \"old hands club,\" usually smirking over the top of a cup of tea.\n\nBoth still had official jobs to do, of course, and they took their roles very seriously. \n\nEva was at the Farm very unofficially. Her role at the Tower had never been one vital to operations, of course… but no one had rushed to ask her back to the market, either. Tess and Banshee had reached out once in a while, and she'd given advice on how to set up their new space.\n\nBut Eva was here at the Farm for the lost. \n\nThey trailed into the place in ones and twos. They all shared something in common: the Shard hadn't connected with them. They came to sit and stare at it, off in the distance. To talk about how hard the Red War had been, as unpowered Guardians—some forced by circumstance to literally sit on the sidelines.\n\nWhen the Light had returned, some of them reported that it felt different. It sat under the skin like a suit that didn't quite fit anymore.\n\nA diminutive Exo woman was one of the pilgrims Eva remembered most clearly. She hadn't even known they made Exos that short. The woman shifted and twitched as she talked, unable to calm herself. \n\nAt the mention of the Light fitting differently, a statement she'd heard a lot of Guardians make, Eva asked the same question she always did. \"So does that mean the Light is different now? Or are you?\"\n\nThe Exo stopped and narrowed her eyes, thinking. She was stock still for the first time since arriving at the Farm. \n\nThat was usually how it went. Sometimes asking the question was all it took to get them sorted out. Others took a lot longer, sometimes spending weeks at a time at the Farm just doing as Eva was: staring up at the Shard.\n\nSome… some came to the Farm, found no answers, and left on foot walking toward that great landmark on the horizon. So far as Eva knew, none of them had ever come back through the Farm.\n\nIt was a strange life. Another strange time, another role she'd never asked for. But she found she was good at it.\n\nAnd Eva Levante had no interest in returning to the City.","name":"Caretaker","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075521,"index":858,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075534":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The comms unit in her little room chirped loudly enough to wake Eva from a sound sleep. Eva had turned the little outbuilding into something of a homey space with use of fabrics and art scavenged from the Dead Zone, but as it often did when she woke suddenly these days, it took her a moment to remember where she was.\n\nShe groaned as she slid out of bed, using nearby furniture to steady herself. The damage the War Beasts had done had been extensive, and even now she could feel the tightness in her legs where the Bray tech had knit bone and sinew back together.\n\nShe slumped into the little chair in front of the comms unit. The light from the screen lit the room, which was otherwise almost completely dark. She blearily peered into the unit, as the image of Tess Everis resolved itself. It was daylight in the City, and Tess was impeccably dressed for work.\n\n\"Do you have any idea what time it is here?\" Eva asked, allowing the annoyance to seep into her words.\n\n\"Yes. I do.\" Something in Tess's voice made Eva sit up and look closer. There was a tightness to Tess's face. She looked… frightened.\n\n\"Tess, what's going on? Are you all right?\" Eva was wide awake now, and plucked at the edge of her teal robe to draw it around her. She was suddenly cold.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sweetheart. Just… wanted you to know right away. I bet Tyra's getting a call from Rahool right now.\" Tess looked down and away before looking up into the camera again. \"Sweetie, Cayde's dead. Something happened out at the Reef yesterday. I don't know all the details, but everyone's talking about it.\"\n\nEva's mouth formed a thin, worried line. She'd never been overly fond of the Hunter Vanguard, but so many people looked up to him. Relied on him. And if something was powerful enough to kill Cayde-6… \"The Legion?\"\n\nTess shook her head. \"Still quiet, as far as word around here goes.\" She gave a dim smile for the first time since Eva had picked up. \"You know how reliable the rumor mill is, though. It could be anything.\"\n\nEva sat back in her chair, frowning. \"I'm sorry, dear. I know you liked him.\" Tess shrugged, trying to play it off. \"Don't give me that, we weren't swapping stories in the Market that long ago.\"\n\nTess stopped, and nodded sadly. \"There's going to be a memorial service, I think. Will you come back for it?\"\n\nIt was Eva's turn to look away from the screen. It was the first time someone had asked her to go back. And for a funeral, of all things. Eva was about to make an excuse when Tess continued, her smoky voice taking on a light tinge of humor.\n\n\"While you're here you can sort out the holiday programming for the frames.\"\n\nEva's eyes widened. \"The frames are doing holidays without me?\"\n\nTess's smile broke into a full grin. \"We were just as surprised! Somehow all of the holiday gear got packed along with critical supplies in the transfer to the new Tower. And when your programs kicked in, they were able to find the tagged crates.\" Tess picked up her comms unit and angled the lens so that it would show the Dawning hat sitting on top of a mannequin in the corner of the room.\n\nEva shook her head, disbelieving. \"They did the Dawning without me.\"\n\nTess's face came back into frame. \"Over the summer, Ikora got someone to help her set up an event to commemorate the end of the War, too.\" \n\nEva tried not to let her annoyance show on her face. \"How was it?\"\n\nTess shook her head from side to side, evaluating. \"Oh… you know. OK.\" When she saw Eva's mouth tighten, Tess laughed. \"It didn't have your touch, sweetie.\" She sighed. \"Oh, it feels good to laugh. Come back to the Tower! Even if it's just to pay your respects. I haven't given you a hug in what feels like years.\"\n\nIn the darkness of her room, Eva turned to look out her window. On the horizon, the dim glow of the Shard was like an anchor, a symbol of the past.\n\nEva looked back toward her friend and smiled.","name":"Invisible Scars","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075534,"index":859,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075535":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Eva Levante pulled opened the door to her storage unit and gagged at the smell. She turned to the two frames who were accompanying her and pointed inside.\n\n\"Start by sanitizing the whole space. When it's clean, we'll start moving in the crates.\" The frames both nodded to her and beeped affirmation. They were already sweeping with abandon as they crossed the threshold. Eva stumped back several paces, supported by her cane, to avoid getting any dirt on her outfit.\n\nAround her, the marketplace swirled with activity. Civilians on break ate at the lunch counter, shoppers browsed the stalls, frames cleaned and patrolled and delivered goods, and Guardians were everywhere—a riot of color and style as they flipped and floated and leapt around the space.\n\nEva scowled, frustrated with herself again for letting Tess and (to an extent) Amanda talk her into returning. None of this felt right, none of it felt… comfortable. And now this space they'd given her to store her wares had apparently last been opened and cleaned sometime before the Faction Wars.\n\nShe found a bench along one of the market's walkways and sank gratefully down, watching the crowd pass by. Fashion, as it always did in the City, had moved quickly since the day the Legion attacked. She was still catching up, still finding her footing. Rebreather masks in particular dotted the faces in the crowd, more stylish and ornamental than practical—a holdover from a necessity in the days rebuilding and restoring the City.\n\nAnd the Guardians! Tess had spent much of their time together since her return filling her in on fashion trends among the Lightbearer set, and Eva was incredibly impressed. Tess, the foundries, even the Vanguard had outdone themselves. Armor designs and shader schemas had improved dramatically since her days at the old Tower.\n\n\"What am I even going to do here?\" she muttered to herself. \"What can I do that…\" she trailed off, watching a Guardian walk by with what appeared to be a full crest rising above his helmet and a Warlock robe that flowed and rippled behind him in the breeze.\n\n\"That's it.\" Eva stood, heading for the door to tell the frames to stop cleaning, when someone stepped into her path. A Guardian in a leather trench coat, with a shiny black helm.\n\n\"Eva?\" The voice was distorted. She could see her own face reflected in the helmet, confused.\n\nThe gloved hands came up and the headpiece came off to reveal the smiling face of Ramos. \"Abuela! It's me!\" He pulled her into an enormous hug as she smiled.\n\n\"You rascal. You never gave me the chance to thank you.\" She swatted him kindly on the shoulder as she pulled away. \"Just save a woman's life and then ride off to retake the City, why don't you?\"\n\nRamos laughed, happier than she'd ever seen him. The Light hung around him easily, and he turned to a pair of Guardians who were standing nearby, watching tentatively. \"Team, this is Eva Levante! You remember my stories? This woman is a legend!\"\n\nHe gestured at the two. \"Eva, these two are shiny as Glimmer. Just became Guardians before the Legion attacked.\"\n\nEva nodded her head deeply to them. \"Good to meet you both.\"\n\nOne raised a hand in an awkward greeting, while the other cocked their head. \"What… do you do here?\"\n\nEva sighed. \"Oh, I'm not… I'm not actually.\"\n\nRamos laughed and said, \"She's a phenomenal seamstress! A hero of the war! And before that, she was one of the pillars of life in the Tower. Remember the Dawning holiday you liked so much? She brought that to the Tower!\"\n\nThe two turned back to her, impressed. \"How did you get Zavala to agree to… to…\"\n\nEva smiled. \"To have fun?\" She laughed at the responses she got from all three Guardians, and tapped her cane twice on the ground. \"That's a very good story. If you have some time?\"\n\nRamos laughed. \"Absolutely! Come, let's get some food. And we can help these Kinderguardians learn a thing about what it means to be part of the Tower.\"\n\nWith help from her friend, Eva Levante walked easily across the market square of the Tower, bastion of the Last Safe City.

But there were enough translations and competent theory to provide a foundation for own interpretations. \n\nIt wasn't long before the pieces started to fall into place.

For those you may—those you will—influence. Collisions yet to come. New paths unimagined. Collateral impacts beyond the narrow view of your own life. Have you considered this? I ask not to sway you; you will find your way, and I will hold off judgment until judgment is necessary.

This man, clad in black and misshapen by the weight of his sins, professed to wield hope as a weapon, to offer it as a crutch, a beacon he saw as false promise. \"Nothing dies like hope,\" he'd say.

When you were wounded at the labs and I saw you were losing your fight, I did what I always did when the chips were down: I… created something. You, Ada-1. From what I had almost completely lost.

I charted the course of your life and made decisions that were yours to make, not mine.\n\nI hope you find it in your heart to forgive me for that.\n\nI was naïve. Looked too often to the past. I just couldn't let any of it go. I never did have much respect for the natural order of things. And Helga, well… she was the opposite of me.

The two of them spent as much time looking ahead as I did looking back.\n\nI realize now that there's a balance to life. You look backward a little, you look forward a little. But most importantly, you live in the here and now. You appreciate what you have, because you never know when it'll all be snatched from you.\n\nLearn from our successes and our missteps. Be bold. Do not fear the future. Respect the past. And never forget where you came from. And try never to fear death, if you can help it. I know I don't anymore.\n\nYou know what's funny?

She has never been so high in the Tower, nor seen the Dawning Crystal up close; only from the City far below. She drops all the packages she was carrying.\n\nThe Warlock Vanguard helps Malia pick them up, piling one parcel on top of another until she realizes Malia is still as stone, kneeling, watching her, watching her hands that had kindled light from air. The poor girl's scarred face is slick with tears, and she wipes them with her sleeve, but the tears will not stop. Malia's family escaped the City during the Red War, you see; though they survived and have a home again, there have never been many beautiful things in their lives.\n\nMalia touches Ikora's arm and mouths a thank-you.

They found themselves in the thick of the forest, with the wind wailing, a storm coming down, branches flying… and realized they had to stay put.\n\nSo, they find the wreckage of a dropship, lean up a wing and crumpled siding, and squeeze all the grown-ups and the two little ones into the dry space under the rusted hull.\n\nThen Amanda's mother says, \"We'll be here a while. Might as well do something to keep our spirits up.\"\n\nShe sends the adults out foraging for something to eat, something to drink, and something to keep dry. Amanda's father comes back with long-leaved plants to weave into mats. Their companions return with full water flasks, some prickly fruit, and a dozen or so wild vegetables like cucumbers. With dried fish from their packs, it is quite the feast.\n\nAs the adults are working, Lucia is curling the rinds from the fruit into little flowers, but little Amanda is kicking her legs, restless. \"Make yourself useful; make some decorations,\" Amanda's mother urges her. She hands Amanda wires and nuts and bolts and a circuit board full of little lights.\n\nLucia comes jumping, an old battery in her hand. Together the girls make miniature garlands of tiny bulbs. And Lucia shows Amanda how to touch the wires to the battery to make them light up. Bright little lights in the vast dark forest.\n\nAmanda told me about the fruit, with soft white flesh and a sour taste. She told me about how they sang made-up songs together with no words, just humming and tapping out a beat on the metal walls of their shelter.\n\nShe doesn't know what the fruit was. Maybe it does not exist anymore. The other family? They got separated from Amanda's people.

So, I go to see Banshee-44 to sort it all out.\n\nThe Exo has no recollection of a delivery.

He returns with two big boxes.\n\n\"These them?\" he asks.\n\nWe open the first one up. Inside, we find a very, very old box of chocolates. Many different portable kits for cleaning weapons. A copy of \"Hunter of the Heart\" (I know this novel, but it is not for everyone). A necklace with a bullet pendant, tucked with care into a little box. Stacks and stacks of Dawning greeting cards.\n\nI shake my head gently. \"Those are presents people have given YOU for the Dawning, Banshee!\"\n\nThe Gunsmith blinks a couple of times.

He lifts the cover.\n\nIt is full of Dawning gifts, wrapped in brightly colored paper and tied with glittery ribbon. Some are in tiny boxes, but some are guns, of course. They are all meticulously labeled.\n\n\"I think these are the presents you are giving out to friends this year, no?\" I ask with a wink.\n\nBanshee gives one brisk nod as he turns over the labels, reading them. I observe that some have detailed instructions. The Exo shrugs.\n\n\"Got in the habit of writing everything down. Sometimes I… I don't always remember.\" He waves the thought away. \"Right.\"\n\n\"I still need my supplies? The boxes I came to get?\" I nudge him.\n\nHe tilts his head a moment and finally raises a finger. \"Oh. I know where they are.\"\n\nBut before he takes away his boxes, I tap the covers. \"You should label them. 'Old Dawning Gifts.' 'New Dawning Gifts—To Be Delivered.'\" He nods at me and scribbles on the lids.\n\n\"I never forget my friends for the Dawning,\" he makes sure to tell me as he hands me my packages.\n\n\"I'm very glad. Happy Dawning, Banshee!\" I reply, squeezing his arm.\n\nI do hope he remembers to get rid of those chocolates.\n\n---\n\nTelemetry Tapioca:\nMix Vex Milk and Bullet Spray, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"It's the Feeling That Counts","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3056981395,"index":909,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3056981396":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Sometimes, when I face something frightening, I think of the strongest people I know and draw strength from them. Suraya Hawthorne is one of those people. I know her brusque attitude can be off-putting, and that's intentional on her part. But once you get past that, there is so much to learn.\n\nShe was orphaned as a young girl, and Devrim and Marc took her in. Honestly, I think having these two as role models is part of why she's as strong as she is. They raised her to be sure of herself and to always do what she thought was right… even though that ultimately led to her having to leave the City.\n\nAs Suraya tells it, she came home one day to find Marc and Devrim sitting at the kitchen table, as though expecting her. They had her sit down, then asked if there was anything she wanted to tell them.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Nope.\"\n\nMarc asked her to try again, but she was silent, so he told her that Executor Hideo had stopped by their home. She asked how he was.\n\n\"You know how he is,\" Devrim said. \"Tell us what happened.\"\n\n\"His face got in the way.\"\n\nMarc took a deep breath and said Hideo claimed to have caught her stealing supplies that morning, and did she have anything to say about that? She did not.\n\nHe reminded her that stealing supplies and breaking a faction leader's nose were both good ways to get kicked out of the City, and Suraya could keep quiet no longer. She almost shouted her explanation: The factions didn't care about the people who needed food and supplies—the people who could not pledge to a faction because they were too busy struggling to survive. She wanted to help them, so she would sometimes steal supplies from New Monarchy.\n\nDevrim asked, \"What about Hideo?\"\n\nSuraya rolled her eyes and groaned, explained that when Hideo had found her, he'd said all manner of nasty, evil things to her: She was worthless, she was nothing, things like that.\n\nDevrim agreed Hideo was… well, I won't repeat it, but suffice to say it means \"an unpleasant person.\" He held a lot of influence, though, and he was insisting Suraya be punished. Harshly. For Suraya's part, this seemed to crystallize something. She tells me that's the first time she knew she wanted to leave the City—that perhaps this had been part of why she'd punched Hideo. She told her guardians and they couldn't believe it.\n\nThey were quiet for a bit. Then Devrim broke the silence. \"Well, let's get packed.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Absolutely not.\" She was not about to let her decisions hurt these men who had taken her in and cared for her. They'd done nothing wrong.\n\nOh, they fought her. As she tells it, they argued a long time, until finally, she shrugged and said, \"If you try to come with me, I'll run away.\"\n\nShe suspected they knew there was no bluff to call, as they spoke now in tired, worried voices, making their case one last time. Suraya was adamant. \"I won't let you suffer for my choices.\" What could they do?\n\nShe asked when she had to leave. Marc said he could hold off Hideo for a day or two so they could all make a plan. His voice became stern again, and he said, \"You're going somewhere close enough that we can come and check on you as often as we like. At least for a while. That is nonnegotiable.\"\n\nHe had no negotiating power, of course. But Suraya had agreed. She stayed very near the City for over a year before saying proper goodbyes and heading out further into the world. \n\nSuraya Hawthorne is, in my mind, the definition of doing what you think is right regardless of the consequences. She knew it was right to help struggling families, she knew it was right to not put Devrim and Marc in harm's way, and she knew it was right to give them some peace of mind by staying close. That is the kind of true courage I have always admired.\n\n---\n\nEliksni Birdseed:\nMix Ether Cane and Personal Touch, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"Our Choices Define Us","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3056981396,"index":910,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3056981397":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Oh, Devrim. Who can meet Devrim and say they don't like him? He looks out for others and helps anyone who asks. I saw him many times after I made my way back to the Farm. He'd come by from time to time, to check in on everyone and make sure everything was going all right. We even sat down to tea a few times. Such a kind, sincere soul. We need more of those, you know.\n\nWe talked many times about the war, and he tried so hard to convince me to arm myself. \"You've seen what's out there,\" he would say, as though I might have forgotten.\n\nWe argued about it time and time again. I had jobs that didn't require fighting, I would explain, and that was intentional. My strongest contributions lay elsewhere, and I meant to keep my focus there.\n\nI remember one conversation in particular where Devrim was absolutely adamant. \"Eva!\" he finally said, louder than I think he meant to. His eyes were urgent, almost angry, as they locked on mine. \"This isn't some 'what if' situation. You've already had to defend yourself. It stands to reason you'll have to again. The Cabal aren't backing down, and they're not the only threat. To know all that and still not even try to protect yourself… it's irresponsible.\"\n\nYes, I had defended myself. And I had hated everything about it.\n\n\"Devrim.\" I kept my voice soft, but my words clear. \"The fighting, the shooting, the mayhem—that's not what I want to be part of. I've seen enough. If it comes for me again—and I agree, it could—then so be it. I want to be part of the healing. I want to be part of what builds us back up. Don't we need that?\"\n\nPoor Devrim finally stopped trying to convince me. He never stopped checking in, though. Old habits, as they say.\n\nWhen I finally came back to the Tower, though, what do you think was waiting for me? The Dawning festival was just beginning, and the Postmaster had a package for me. Inside, a beautiful sidearm—ornate design, antique coloring—and a note. From Devrim, of course.\n\nAt first I was indignant—after all our conversations! I had half a mind to simply throw this gun away. Instead, I read the note.\n\n\"Eva, my friend!\n\nI was sorry to hear you'd left the Farm after all, but very glad to know you'll be among dear friends. In that spirit, and in the spirit of the Dawning, I wanted to offer you this gift. This has been passed down through my family for generations. It's a Kay family heirloom—and before you throw it away, you should know that it doesn't fire. I thought this might be a nice compromise, and I hope you'll accept it.\n\nI hope the Tower treats you well, old friend.\n\n—Devrim\"\n\nI read the note a few more times, then folded it and put it in my pocket.\n\nI looked down once more at this beautiful heirloom—a symbol of friendship, of family—and reflected on the fact that somehow, despite everything, I'd managed to rediscover both.\n\n---\n\nGentleman's Shortbread:\nMix Ether Cane and Perfect Taste, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"Extended Family","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3056981397,"index":911,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3056981398":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Every Dawning, I receive many greeting cards from customers. The ones I treasure the most contain stories about how people all across our solar system observe the holiday. One of my favorite letters came from someone who was a customer of mine but once: Lady Sloane, Stoneborn out on Titan, one of Saturn's moons.\n\n\"Dear Eva,\n\n\"Happy Dawning.\n\n\"First, thanks for the delivery; all the requisitions arrived in perfect condition, and you did a great job packaging up the chicken (more on that later). We tried decorating the railings outside our Command Center with the garlands, but the Fallen have been using the lights for target practice. I guess we'll be getting some more next year and prettying up the break room instead. A couple of the Dawning lanterns got whipped away in the wind, too—we're not known for our clement weather out here on the methane seas.\n\n\"Some Guardians who've been helping me out on Titan mentioned that you like to hear about Dawning traditions outside the City, so here's how we celebrate on this moon we call home.\n\n\"This year, I let the crew off duty early, 1600 hours, and took a whole hour off myself so we could have ourselves a little Dawning soirée in our Command Center.\n\n\"Siren's Watch has got quite a view of the waves and some floating platforms, so we pushed our break room tables together, end to end, and looked out at the horizon while we shared a communal feast. Seeing as the room is exposed to the elements (the glass view window broke long ago, but repairing it just hasn't been a priority), Del and Ari had to bundle up—and we had to weigh the tablecloth down with chunks of metal. I've had worse setups.\n\n\"Eva, it was the best meal I've had in ages. That chicken? Delicious. Every one of us got to try a piece. We cut our protein rations into fun shapes, and once we got your taffy warmed up enough to chew, it was heaven.\n\n\"We exchanged Dawning gifts as well. Somebody even cross-stitched me an 'inspirational quote' to hang in my quarters ('Where's my beacon?'; it's an in-joke). Decent tools, Heavy ammo, thick socks—those are the kinds of gifts that change hands out here. Maybe that doesn't impress people accustomed to the Dawning in the Tower, but those presents have worth to us.\n\n\"When we joined hands afterward, whether for warmth or just conviviality, we got to talking in a way we never really had before. I don't think I've ever voluntarily shared stories about myself in my life! We talked about who we were before the Red War, where we came from, and even where we might want to go in the future.\n\n\"It's not easy here on this storm-tossed moon—one jolt and you're tumbling off a platform into eternity. Between the Fallen and the Hive and the elements, we're always just struggling to stay alive. But as we sat there chatting, we FELT alive.\n\n\"I guess I wrote all this just to say thank you, Eva, for reminding us to take a moment to appreciate and rejoice, no matter what. I find that inspiring.\n\n\"Sincerely,\n\"Sloane\"\n\nI have never left Earth, and Titan sounds like a… very interesting place. But reading how this holiday has brought people together in such faraway places, I feel all my efforts have been worth it.\n\nI hope to see Sloane again someday.\n\n---\n\nAlkane Dragée Cookies:\nMix Chitin Powder and Bullet Spray, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"The Dawning on the Stormy Seas","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3056981398,"index":912,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3056981399":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I had heard of the Exodus colony ships before. I didn't remember much about them—just one of those names from history lessons that sticks with you. To tell you the truth, I had forgotten about it until more recently, when some Guardians told me they found one of them crashed on Nessus—and explained what had happened to its Failsafes.\n\nI understand they were originally one AI—the ship's navigational intelligence—but with time, they separated. It sounds to me like one of them is always happy, and the other is always sad. That's no way to live for either of them. These things must exist in balance. I know they're computers, but I worry for them.\n\nOne Guardian in particular spoke to me recently of the time he told the Failsafes about the Dawning festival. He had just turned some bounties in to them and mentioned that he was excited to get back to Earth to participate in the festivities. They stopped him and asked him to explain what that meant—they had never heard of the Dawning! He said something to the effect of, \"It's a winter celebration that combines several old Earth traditions.\"\n\nThey responded—I will try to word this exactly as he did, since he prided himself on his imitation of them—they responded by the happy one saying, \"According to my database, Earth's 'winter' occurs when one hemisphere is oriented away from the sun! Why do you celebrate being cold?\" Then the sad one said, \"I mean, I can't feel cold, but it sounds awful.\"\n\nSo this Guardian said something like, \"It's more that we're celebrating each other,\" which I love, because that is how I've always thought of it as well. We're all here together, eating sweets and being with each other.\n\nThe Failsafes asked a few more questions and then the happy one said, \"If we are celebrating each other, how can I participate in the Dawning? I am all alone. It is very depressing!\" The sad one said, \"I'm not gonna celebrate the Fallen.\"\n\nMy Guardian friend thought quickly and said, \"You can wish every Guardian that comes out to Nessus a happy Dawning! Celebrate with us! We would love that.\"\n\nThat seemed to cheer both of them up a bit, so I'm glad he thought to say it. Apparently, they practiced wishing him a happy Dawning for the better part of an hour, so I expect they're quite good at it now. Go visit them if you have a chance.

Way back then, I was very busy getting the Vanguard and the other Tower vendors excited about the Dawning. In turn, many reached out to me about anything related to the holiday. Still, I was surprised that the Warlock Vanguard would seek me out—and to talk about Eris Morn, of all people!\n\nI might have shuddered in spite of myself.\n\n\"I saw you chatting with her as you were getting the decorations set up…\"\n\nWhat I recalled was Eris talking at me about abysses while I was trying to hang lanterns, but I did not want to say that to Ikora.\n\nShe continued, \"I am worried about her. She seems quite depressed.\"\n\nI flicked my eyes up at Ikora and then looked away. To my credit, I did not snort.\n\n\"She's even more morose than usual, and the technicians in the Hall of Guardians are complaining. Eva, could you talk to her? Perhaps… get her to help you out? Surely you could use an extra set of hands.\"\n\nA terrible idea, but again, I could not say so. Instead I suggested, \"Perhaps she has a friend—well, maybe not a 'friend'—but somebody she likes to talk to, someone who she has something in common with…\" I trailed off, remembering who we were speaking of.\n\nBut Ikora perked up. \"There is someone she addresses voluntarily—a Gensym scribe named Asher Mir. He's also, well… He's an excellent scholar. I'll reach out to him, unless YOU know him, of course…\"\n\n\"I don't!\" I said brightly. \"But I hope it goes well; I want everybody to have a happy Dawning. Now if you'll excuse me, I do have deliveries to make.\"\n\nI wasn't yet familiar enough with Ikora to squeeze her arm in farewell, so I nodded and made my escape.\n\nBut when I crossed paths with her again later that day, what a look she gave me! \"I talked to Asher, as you suggested,\" she muttered.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He grumbled at first. He seemed unaware that the Dawning was taking place, in fact. But I explained, and when I told him it would be… very well regarded if he wrote her a Dawning greeting card or went to visit her, he said he could write a card. He also said he had a Dawning gift for her.\"\n\n\"Oh! How kind!\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" she sighed and produced a piece of parchment.\n\nIt was folded in four to form a greeting card. Nothing on the cover, but inside was written, \"Eris, the Warlock Vanguard has approached me about 'cheering you up' for a holiday that is going on. I shall seize this serendipitous opportunity to send you the research notes you demanded of me on heretical practices among the Hive, however spurious the grounds for your request. Warmest wishes to you this Dawning! —Asher Mir\"\n\n\"Did you dictate that last part to him, Ikora?\"\n\nShe paused for a moment. \"Yes.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Well, you had better take it to her. I wouldn't call Hive research a traditional Dawning present, but she did request it.\"\n\nIkora shook her head wearily, and we parted ways.\n\nLater that same day, as I was about to head out on my last round of deliveries, Ikora approached me yet again.\n\nShe told me, \"I went to see Eris. I don't know if she's any more cheerful, although she did say, 'Ah yes, I had been expecting these notes for some time now. Good.' She even wrote a Dawning message back to Asher.\"\n\nIkora handed me back the same piece of parchment that her scribe colleague had used, but it had been refolded. I read, \"Asher: Take heed not to succumb to the whispers, as fools do. Warmest wishes to you this Dawning! —Eris Morn\"\n\nI shrugged.\n\nThe Warlock cleared her throat. \"Eris also had a Dawning gift for me to pass on to Asher.\"\n\n\"At least she's making an effort.\"\n\n\"Well…\" Ikora hauled me aside and took out a small, lumpy packet wrapped in cloth. She peeled back the layers of tissue with care. And there it was. The Dawning gift glowed with a sickly green luminescence.\n\n\"I can't give this to him!\" Ikora hissed. \"I can just...\" She looked around for eavesdroppers. \"...get rid of it, right?\"\n\n\"This is beyond a question of Dawning etiquette,\" I whispered back.\n\nShe nodded, her face set. \"Let us never speak of this again.\"\n\n---\n\nRadiolarian Pudding:\nMix Vex Milk and Electric Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"A Cautionary Tale","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3056981400,"index":914,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3056981401":{"displayProperties":{"description":"It's not only my customers who keep me running about.

Eva Levante does not tattle about sensitive matters.\n\nHe was carrying a formidable piece of weaponry, a complicated curve of many metal parts with a thick string connecting the ends. \"It's a compound bow,\" he explained, following my stare. \"For shooting arrows.\" I raised my eyebrows in puzzlement.\n\nOn that weapon, he had placed a large pouf of red velvet ribbon.

I wouldn't know the difference between those weapons, but I understood his problem.\n\n\"But maybe a book would be better?\" he asked.\n\n\"Again, it depends which book you choose.\"\n\n\"I have read Ikora's 'On Circles: Revised Edition,' and it was very good.\"\n\n\"That is a terrible Dawning gift.

Should I replace it?\"\n\n\"Maybe you should not remind her of a bad thing happening…\"\n\nHe didn't reply to this, so I went on, \"Perhaps this bow is already the right Dawning gift for your friend. Do you think she would use it?\"\n\n\"Definitely.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" I smiled, \"you have your answer. Happy Dawning to you and your friend both!\"\n\n\"And to you, Eva.

She also had a cheeky curl to her lip and a hand on her hip, and she tap-tap-tapped her fingers as she waited. By this, I guessed she was a Hunter.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Miss…?\" I greeted her.\n\nShe launched right in. \"Can you help me put together a really small, intimate Dawning celebration? Do you have, like, a kit or something?\" she asked, peering back over her shoulder with impatience. \"It's a surprise for… somebody who's used to the Dawning in the City, only now we're all the way over on Mars, so…\"\n\n\"Ah! Well, the Dawning basics are decorations, shared food, and gifts. First: you have a choice of lanterns\"—I pointed to the colorful spheres lining the shop—\"and candles\"—I produced a box of tea candles from under the counter and thumped it down in front of her—\"and streamers.\"\n\n\"Candles and streamers are a fire hazard.

I also happened to scan the spines of the thick books, some with very long titles, all labeled, \"Fu'an Library – REFERENCE – DO NOT REMOVE.\"\n\nThe Hunter noticed my frown and shoved the books into her satchel. \"Here's what I picked. Think she'll like it?\"\n\nI didn't know who 'she' was. But I admired the necklace she was showing off: an elongated pendant with an emblem of a little bird, of exquisite workmanship.\n\nShe grinned, \"That design is Golden Age, but the pendant also holds thirty-five petabytes of data!\"\n\nI returned her smile. I also convinced her to buy a sturdy book bag and purple wrapping paper.\n\n\"There! Your own personal Dawning in a bag!\" I said, tucking away her Glimmer and handing over her purchases. \"I hope your companion enjoys the surprise.\"\n\nThe Hunter bobbed her head in thanks and turned to go.\n\n\"Anastasia!\"\n\nWho did I see then but Commander Zavala, standing arms akimbo in the corridor as the press of the afternoon shopping crowd flowed around him.\n\n\"Zavala,\" muttered the Hunter.

I spent a bit of time telling him about our festival anyway, explaining our traditions and the meanings behind them. He nodded along, seemingly very attentive. I tried to bring the conversation back to him.\n\n\"So, Drifter, where are you—\"\n\n\"Well, best be on my way!\" he said, pretending not to hear me as he backed up. \"I've taken up enough of your time—who knows how much any of us has left.\" As he walked off, he tossed back, \"Like the décor! Good colors!\" then disappeared around a corner.\n\nI've heard other people talk about this strange man. They mostly say the same things: very friendly, if a little mysterious. On the other hand, I've also heard some things I won't repeat—they're far too gruesome to be true, and I won't facilitate spreading false rumors. I'm sure his eating habits are no different from yours or mine.\n\nSuffice to say, something is off about him. I'd recommend keeping an eye on him.\n\n---\n\nDark Chocolate Motes:\nMix Taken Butter and Null Taste, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"A Friendly Face","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3073758978,"index":917,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3073758977":{"displayProperties":{"description":"What I have loved most since coming back to the Tower is reconnecting with everyone. I missed my friends while I was away, and I thought about them every day. Even when you're doing what you know is right, it can be hard not to wish for times past.\n\nI've wanted so much to catch up on everything I missed, but these Guardians are so busy, always flitting in and out. You can barely get a word out of them most of the time. I feel like so much has happened, but I get only drips of information.\n\n\"Spider\" is a name I hear over and over, but who is he? A common criminal? A deity? A friend? Some accounts paint him as all three. What is it about this Spider fellow that compels these Guardians so?\n\nAnd do I have it right that he feeds on Ghosts? Ghosts! What an utterly despicable practice. Even the most detestable Ghost doesn't deserve that kind of treatment. (Yes, I am thinking of one in particular, but… I'm afraid old Eva will keep that secret to herself.)\n\nFrom what I can put together, this Spider fellow had a group of Barons, I think. If that's correct, his relationship with them seemed… tenuous. I don't know what one gets up to on this Tangled Shore, but I think he had them all killed.\n\nBefore that, though, Spider's Barons broke into some kind of high-security prison out in space. They were looking for… something belonging to Spider. I don't know what it was. Maybe it was Ghosts or maybe it was weapons—although why he'd have someone look for those things in a prison, I don't know. While his Barons were in there, the prisoners started to fight them. That rascal Cayde-6 was also in the prison, on a mission that I don't think was related to Spider's mission. They ended up in the same fight, though, from what it sounds like. Then, while everyone was fighting, the Reef Queen's brother arrived!\n\nWhen I first heard this story, at this point I thought to myself, \"Oh, good! Finally someone on our side. The Awoken Prince will help get things in order.\" Now, keep in mind that I had always heard he was… a bit stiff. But also that he was willing to help when it came down to it. That was before his sister, though. Loss can do terrible, ugly things to us.\n\nThis leads me to the only detail I know with absolute certainty: Uldren Sov killed Cayde-6.\n \nI don't know why, but I suspect it was in part because the Prince succumbed to the pain in his heart and lost the ability to see things as they are. Anyway, once Spider's Barons left the prison, they ran all over the Reef. I guess they had found what Spider was looking for, but decided to keep those things for themselves. This Spider sent people after the Barons, and I don't think any of the Barons survived.\n\nWhile all this was going on, someone killed Uldren. I assume it was revenge for Cayde, but I can't get anyone to tell me with certainty who did it. Based on everything else I hear about this Spider, I wonder if Uldren wasn't also his work.\n\nMany of my Guardian friends are still doing favors for this… creature who, at best, betrays his own people. I am not sure that road leads anywhere good. Though perhaps I don't have the whole truth.\n\nThis is no history lesson. Take it however you will. Some people just don't have time to talk to old Eva, it seems.\n\n---\n\nCandy Dead Ghosts:\nMix Dark Ether Cane and Flash of Inspiration, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"A Tale Twice Told","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3073758977,"index":918,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3073758976":{"displayProperties":{"description":"What are the Awoken?\n\nNot in the sense of \"how did they come to be?\" I don't care about that any more than about how the Cabal or the Fallen came to be. As far as I'm concerned, the universe decided it wanted them, and so it made them. Who am I to question the universe?\n\nI've heard people talk about Petra Venj and the Tangled Shore lately. It's very confusing—roped-together rocks? And you just… jump between them? It's no wonder that Reefborn Awoken are so often suspicious of others if they grow up unable to even trust the ground!\n\nBut the Awoken as a whole… I feel like my grasp of them has certainly grown, but there are things I still don't understand. They are certainly part of what we consider \"humanity,\" just as much as Humans or Exos. I know this and believe it, but what makes it so?\n\nIs it because they are… made… like we are? The Cabal are built roughly as we are, but we do not consider them part of humanity.\n\nIs it our shared relationship with the Traveler? As hard as it is to believe, I have heard the Fallen had a relationship with the Traveler. But they are not part of humanity. \n\nDoes \"humanity\" consider only those who choose to walk among Humans? But by that logic, Reefborn Awoken who remain in the Reef are not part of humanity. I don't believe that's true, and yet…\n\nPetra has spent most of her life in the Reef, hasn't she? I know she was here playing Emissary for a while, but she has always considered the Reef her true home. Would she describe herself as part of humanity? I think if you walked up to Petra and asked, \"Are you a member of humanity?\" she would respond, \"I am an Awoken of the Reef.\" If you pressed her further and asked, \"Yes, but which side are you on?\" I believe she would say, \"The side of Queen Mara Sov.\"\n\nSo then is humanity something we choose? Or is it ascribed to you? Is it a title to be earned or a birthright, a heritage? Are the Awoken part of humanity due to one of these stipulations, or—\n\nCould it be that the Awoken are part of humanity because of ALL of these stipulations? Individually, these ideas don't define humanity any more than a cloak defines a Hunter, but COLLECTIVELY—that they are built as we are, that they share our relationship with the Traveler, and that many of them gladly walk among us here on Earth… Maybe THAT is what makes them part of humanity—everything bound together, just as we are all bound together.\n\nThat togetherness is what helped us win the Red War, and I truly believe it will help us push back the Darkness for good. Never forget that our unity is what makes us strong, and the Awoken will always be part of that.\n\n---\n\nIll-Fortune Cookies:\nMix Dark Ether Cane and Impossible Heat, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"What Makes Us One","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3073758976,"index":919,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3073758983":{"displayProperties":{"description":"There is a strange fellow who… well, perhaps you've seen him. He doesn't really come and go as you or I might traditionally think. It's more that you turn around, and he is either there or he is not. His appearances are steady and predictable, at least. He's called Xûr. I'm not sure why one draws the tiny arrow over his name, but it's important to try and respect the wishes of those we don't understand.\n\nThe first time I ever saw Xûr, I was by myself at my stall in the Tower. The Old Tower, I suppose you'd call it now. I hadn't been there long at all. I looked up, and this man had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere! His back was to me, but even from behind, something seemed off about him. Something in his posture. As he started to turn, I noticed his whole face appeared to be covered in hair. It even seemed to be moving, gently flowing on its own—but there was no wind.\n\nWhen the light hit his face, I screamed and ducked down behind part of my cabinets. I was sure this abomination had come to invade us, that more of them were just out of sight, that we were done for.\n\nEventually, I realized no one else was screaming. I heard no sounds of distress. I peeked out and saw that everyone was going about their business. No one was panicking but me! Many people saw him—several were interacting with him.\n\nSlowly, I stood back up and tried to go about my business—though I rarely looked away. Tess came over before too long, and I asked her about the strange figure.\n\n\"Oh, that's Xûr!\" she said, unconcerned. \"He comes through every so often and sells particular, hard-to-find things.\" She considered him for a moment, then added, \"Could do with a bit of a wardrobe update, if you ask me, but he's otherwise harmless.\"\n\n\"What is he?\" I asked. \"I've never seen a creature like that before.\"\n\n\"Xûr is… I believe he's called a Jovian. They're from out beyond even the Reef. I'm afraid I don't know much else about them.\"\n\n\"But they're… friendly?\"\n\n\"Well, they don't attack us, if that's what you mean. I don't know that I'd call Xûr friendly, but he's not hostile.\"\n\nI felt more at ease after our conversation, though I still could not shake my fear. For many months, I jumped every time I saw him and had to fight back the instinct to hide.\n\nEventually, I grew used to his presence. I even began to appreciate his predictability—it became a symbol that everything was functioning as it should. The fear evaporated with time.\n\nI have often found that my first reaction to new things is fear. Perhaps it is this way for everyone. However, I have also found that if I accept and acknowledge my fear, it is easier to push through until I am no longer afraid. The new thing has almost never been as frightening as I first feared.\n\n---\n\nStrange Cookies:\nMix Taken Butter and Electric Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"You Get Used to Him","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3073758983,"index":920,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3073758982":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I don't know very much about the prophecies of the controversial Warlock, Osiris.

They die there.\n\nDon't ask me where I heard that. But don't be surprised—if you think the people of the City don't poke fun at you Guardians now and again, you're not paying attention.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI heard rumors about Brother Vance, one of Osiris's followers. The rumors started like myths: how he might use the knowledge discovered by Osiris to perform miracles or to raise Guardians to their full potential. Then, for a reason I couldn't see myself, the rumors changed: Vance was a fanatic unacquainted with Osiris, left waiting endlessly on the sands of Mercury for something that would never come.\n\nGuardians are so full of action. I think they couldn't empathize with such passivity.\n\nAs for me, I think we should believe in things and people we can see for ourselves. What someone does now is better proof of their spirit than what they are fabled to have done. It seems to me that waiting forever for your hero to return, poring over the same books and letters, relying on a hope for the future you cannot control… well. I see it as wasted time.\n\nThen, I tend toward action myself. Busy hands, busy mind.\n\nBut I also think it must be lonely and disheartening to be abandoned by your idol, even if that abandonment exists only in your own mind. I imagine a man like Vance holds a lonely vigil. I think, perhaps, he knows what people say about him, and he tries to lift himself above it—and drives himself further into isolation.\n\nBut then, I've never met him.

Their stories of a beautiful place filled with towering cliffs and ancient, holy buildings were like fairytales to me. As with many of the stories I hear from Guardians, I marveled that such a thing could be real.\n\nI remember, in particular, an Awoken Warlock named Nadya, who came to visit me in the way many Guardians do: quiet, sheepish, hoping for tea.\n\nI always welcome them in for a cup, of course.\n\nThat day, Nadya sat at my table with her untouched cup of tea. If I hadn't already spent so much time cheering people up in my kitchen, I might have pressed her, but I knew better. I waited. Eventually, she looked up at me.\n\n\"I feel like I found a piece of myself and then lost it, all at once,\" Nadya said, soft and sad. \"I know Guardians aren't meant to look to their heritage beyond the Traveler, but the Dreaming City felt like…\" She trailed off.\n\n\"Home?\" I said.\n\nNadya lowered her eyes. \"Yes. Like home.\" She was quiet, and then looked at me again. \"Is that wrong?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Of course not. Home is not always a single place, you know. I've had many homes.\"\n\nNadya nodded and pushed her tea cup around on the table, distracted. This time, I had to wait a while before she would speak again. Eventually, she said, \"I feel like I'm mourning the loss of something I never really had.\"\n\nI don't fully understand the curse that plagues the Awoken homeland. I know that it came about through great misunderstanding and peril. I know that Uldren Sov and another creature I have never heard of were at the center of that peril. But, from what I hear, there were no clear enemies in that story. No single place to lay blame.\n\nThat can make it so much harder to accept.\n\nNadya's heartbreak was tangible. I felt it in my own heart. But, even as I saw her suffering, I also saw Nadya stand up and go back to her work.

I watch the ships coming in, and the birds, and the clouds—I get so busy that it helps to step away for a little while and remind myself of what's outside. The other day, I was sitting on this bench when a very tall Titan stepped up beside me, his hands folded in front of him.\n\n\"Excuse me, ma'am,\" he said. \"Would you mind if I sit here?\"\n\nI smiled and shifted over to make room. \"Please,\" I said. He sat. His shoulders were so broad that I had to shift over a little more.\n\nHe had a bag of birdseed with him, and I watched as he spread a little of it on the ground. The pigeons came quickly—in fact, I'd noticed a few more than usual the instant he sat down. I wondered to myself how often he came here and how we'd managed to miss each other thus far. He was not an easy man to miss.\n\nThe cooing of the pigeons and the far-off bustle of the City were soothing, and seeing as the gentleman seemed to have no trouble with companionable silence, I closed my eyes. After a moment, though, I was aware of footsteps and whispering behind us. A young woman, another Titan, came up to the bench and said to the gentleman, smiling nervously, \"It's such an honor to meet you. You're an inspiration to Titans everywhere.\"\n\nHe nodded humbly. \"Thank you,\" he said. They spoke briefly. He asked her name. They talked about how she'd just come back from being stationed on Io for patrol duty. He commended her commitment to keeping the people of the system safe, and then she and her friends left.\n\nMy companion went back to feeding the pigeons. After a moment, I asked him, mostly joking, \"Are you famous?\"\n\nHe glanced at me and inclined his head, hesitantly. \"A little bit.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said, smiling. After a moment, I added, \"My name is Eva.\"\n\n\"Saint.\"\n\nI sat with that answer for a moment and then asked, \"Saint-14?\" I'd heard the story of how he fought for the City during the Battle of Six Fronts, so long ago, and another more fantastical story about how he'd defeated a powerful Fallen fellow by headbutting him. Anytime I heard that story, I always found myself hoping he had a good, sturdy helmet.\n\n\"That's right,\" he said, spreading a little more birdseed. \"It is a pleasure to meet you, Eva.\"\n\nWe sat a little longer together, watching the pigeons and the clouds, before I finally had to excuse myself to go back to my work.\n\nAs I said, I'd heard the legend of Saint-14 before.

She didn't care to overtake the project of designing shaders for the Dawning, but she acted as a quiet and talented consultant. Over the next week or so, we spent many hours together sorting through rolls of fabric, comparing colors, considering combinations.

Yes, the stakes are different for a Guardian than for the rest of us—but is the emotional toll so different? How much do you rely on desensitizing yourselves to fear and trauma in order to do your essential work? Ikora tells me not to think on this.

In any case, that very first meeting left a sour taste in my mouth. I hate to admit that I avoided Zavala when I could after that—though sometimes he makes himself unavoidable.\n\nIt wasn't long after this meeting that I celebrated my first Dawning at the Tower. Everyone's spirits were high, and it was so nice to see the people I had come to care about smiling and toasting each other. I remember Tess and I had just finished with a bit of decorating, and she had left to get something when Zavala began heading my way. \"Oh no,\" I thought. \"Oh no, not this man.\" Ah, but he came over anyway, so I smiled and wished him a Happy Dawning—because I DID wish good things for him. It is often the sternest among us who hold the saddest hearts.\n\nHe wished me the same, and then—I almost couldn't believe it—he smiled!

I gave the warmest smile I could to encourage him, and he went on to tell one of the longest, most awkward jokes I have ever heard. And listen, I loved every minute of it. Truly, I couldn't have been happier. Oh, I clapped and laughed along with what I swear was real, true joy from Zavala. To have such a guarded soul open like that—few things are more beautiful. I admired him so in that moment, that he could push himself beyond the boundaries he'd held himself to. I remember hoping that I could someday be so brave in my own way. For the first time, I didn't just respect him as one of the City leaders. For the first time, I felt real, genuine affection for Zavala, the person. Zavala, my friend.\n\nHe has been dear to my heart ever since.\n\n---\n\nGjallardoodles:\nMix Ether Cane and Delicious Explosion, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"Lighter Days","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3056981392,"index":928,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2417017736":{"displayProperties":{"description":">>CLARION RETINA BURN>>\nV330CRF104MES492\nAI-COM/RSPN: ASSETS//WARWATCH//IMPERATIVE\nCONTINGENT ACTION ORDER\n\nThis is a WARWATCH ASSETS IMPERATIVE (NO HUMAN REVIEW) (secure/AUTARCHY).\n\nStand by for CRITERIA:\n\nUnder CARRHAE WHITE\nIf [θ] is INACTIVE and UNRECOVERABLE\nIf event rank is SKYSHOCK: OUTSIDE CONTEXT and CONTEXT is CRONUS\nIf VOLUSPA is ACTIVE and PRIMED [[synapse to DVALIN::ABHORRENT]]\nIf YUGA is ACTIVE and in ECLIPSE\nIf a CIVILIZATION KILL EVENT is predicted [[E<0.005]]\nIf tactical morality is built at MIDNIGHT\n\nExecute DECISION POINT:\n\nActivate LOKI CROWN\n\nCancel counterforce objectives\n\nActivate NAGLFAR STEP\n\nActivate KALKI GOLEM\n\nExecute ALL ASSETS IMPERATIVE ACHAEA KNOX (unsecured/OUTCRY) at SM CALADBOLG\n\nBegin transfer.

They were Risen, beings said to be unkillable, and they fought against each other in a war without end somewhere beyond Eaton's borders. This particular group, the Iron Lords, represented new ideology, and claimed they fought to put an end to the fighting.\n\nLed by a man named Dryden, they had paid each family in Eaton several months' worth of supplies and rations to stay the week. They planned to stage an ambush on another of their kind, known only as the Red Man.\n\nTwo weeks ago, survival was in doubt. Now, because of the generosity of the Iron Lords, their little town would make it through the winter.\n\nGermaine's friend Judson emerged from a neighboring supply shed and stuck a single finger in the air as the riders strode up. Germaine chuckled and shook his head, but said nothing.\n\n\"How you livin',\" Judson  greeted the Risen, holding his finger high.\n\n\"Settle down, Judson,\" Germaine called out.\n\n\"Shut your hole, Germaine,\" Judson returned, hand still in the air. \"Your name is stupid, and you're stupid, too.\"\n\nGermaine shook his head and grinned ruefully.\n\nJudson had warned the town against the arrangement, shouting to everyone who would listen that he'd take care of food, that the \"iron freaks\" would only bring trouble. He was a very good huntsman—possibly the best Eaton had ever seen, and somehow produced deer, duck, and bull from the decimated hills. But even Judson had come up short for months. The war beyond Eaton had intensified. The adults went hungry so the children could eat. It wasn't a sustainable position.\n\n\"We'll be out of your way soon,\" said one of the Iron Lords, who nodded at Judson as he passed by. Her voice was as metallic and cold as her helmet.

She paced slowly back and forth across the length of the shack, stepping carefully over the game of cards Germaine had laid out on the bare dirt floor.\n\n\"I know. But Judson says a lot of things.

Half the town came out to see them.\n\nOne of the men wore red armor that fit the description of the Warlord that Dryden and his Lords were waiting for.\n\nThey say that one Risen, reasonably armed, can annihilate an army. Two Risen, assuming adequate cover for Ghost support, can fight infinite armies indefinitely.\n\nSix Warlords dismounted their machines in a line at the center of town, weapons drawn. They dropped Judson on his knees in front of them. No restraints. He looked unhurt.\n\n\"Does anyone want to claim this runt?\" asked the Red Man.\n\n\"We will,\" Germaine said. People groaned. Yu tried to run to Judson, but her parents held her back.\n\n\"A question, first,\" said the Red Man. \"Where are the Iron Lords? We saw one of their Ghosts. One of these?\" He tapped the bladed carapace of his own drone companion as it floated past him, its eye fixed on the townspeople. \"They like to meddle. Maybe they helped you, brought you some food? It would explain how you survive out here in this wasteland. But I can guarantee you their motivations are not in your best interest.\" The Red Man paused, scanned the crowd as his Ghost orbited above him.\n\n\"The Iron Lords are trying to disrupt the established order. And we're here to liberate you from them. You're under our care, now. So. Where are they?\"\n\nGermaine shut his eyes a long moment. When no one else spoke, he decided he would. \"You're right. They were here. But they're long gone. We paid them for supplies and they moved on a week ago.\"\n\n\"Did they?\" The Red Man raised his hand cannon and shot Yu's father in the head. The entire crowd flinched and huddled together as the man fell backward. Yu's mother cried out in fury, but held her child tight.\n\n\"Hand to my heart,\" Germaine said, holding his breath as he waited for the hidden Iron Lords to make a move. The Red Man held his gun in the air, watching the townspeople intently. The other Warlords scanned the horizon, gleaming weapons at the ready.\n\nJudson took the pregnant pause as an opportunity to pull a Fallen shock blade from one of the Warlord machines. He gave a triumphant yell and decapitated the armored Risen closest to him. As the body fell, he jabbed the length of the blade through the Red Man's back. A third Warlord pulled the glaive out of Judson's hands and stabbed him in the side with a gauntlet blade, then hurled him backwards over the machines.\n\nAll hell broke loose around Germaine as the Iron Lords suddenly opened fire from their positions in the surrounding hills. The townspeople scattered as the fallen Warlords rose in scintillating pillars of Light, the weapons in their hands roaring to life and spitting tracers.\n\n**\n\nThe Ghost watched from high above the chaos. Over the ages, it had gotten very good at hiding. It had gotten very good at all the peculiar things its chosen had asked it to learn.\n\nDown below, gunfire and explosions of Light tore through the collection of huts and shacks. The townspeople fled for their lives in the midst of fire and otherworldly flame as the Iron Lords finally abandoned their sniper positions in the hills to close in on the Warlords at the town center.\n\nThrough it all, the Ghost saw one of the men emerge out of the discharge of an errant explosive device, cradling the body of a child. He moved to relative safety behind one of the shacks and knelt down, holding an ear to the child's face. She was trying to speak.\n\nOne of the armored riders in the town square raised a heavy machine gun in one hand and raked the length of Eaton with golden tracers. The Ghost lost visibility on the townspeople as the hail of machinegun fire filled its vantage point with a rolling cloud of dirt and dust.\n\nThe annihilating, sense-shattering explosions came soon after, and the Ghost increased its elevation.\n\nIt waited until long after the battle had died out, and the surviving Risen had all left, before lowering itself back to earth. It wasn't even sure which side had won. It didn't matter.\n\nThe day had turned to dusk.","name":"Home, pt.

Almost nothing was where he remembered it. Eaton was gone. Blasted and paved. Mild climate was the only reason the shacks and huts that made up most of the town remained standing.\n\nBut the storm of Light versus Light had left scorched earth and shadows behind. And the bones of the dead. It was a blood red dusk. Ghost hovered above him.\n\nThe man looked down at his hands. He tried to chuckle, but coughed instead.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" Ghost asked.\n\nHe stood up, straighter than he had in a long time. Easier to seem like people when you slouch.\n\n\"Germaine?\" Ghost asked.\n\n\"That's not my name.\"\n\n\"You let them call you that.\"\n\nThe man turned to look at his Ghost. \"It's not my name. One 'a the Warlords mentioned seeing a lone Ghost. Did you get sloppy?\"\n\nGhost nodded. \"I'm sorry. I was scouting a new livestock route for you and I got carried away.\"\n\n\"I don't ask for much,\" said the man, shaking his head. \"Shovel. Get me one.\"\n\nGhost scanned the debris and ash to find a charred spade, lifting it with a lasso of Light.\n\nThe man slowly gathered all the bones he could find and began to dig.\n\n\"The child. Yu,\" Ghost continued.\n\n\"Stop talking,\" he replied.\n\n\"What did she tell you? You were speaking to her at the end.\"\n\nHe didn't respond. It would be lifetimes before he told Ghost the answer. But he would remember.\n\n\"You could have helped her.\"\n\nThe shovel hit the dirt harder. \"I told you to shut up.\"\n\n\"You could have saved them all.\"\n\nThe man had nothing to say.\n\nHe must have been making more noise than he thought, because just as he finished digging a grave big enough for the bones, a voice called out. He dropped the shovel, stared across the vacant town square at the smoldering ruin of the Diaz barn.\n\nEaton was dead. No point in keeping his secret any longer.\n\nHe crossed the distance at a speed and ease that would have shocked his neighbors and rounded a corner to find Judson, on the ground, leaning against the barn door. There was a cannon in Judson's hand, and his eyes opened wide when he recognized the man and his Ghost.\n\nJudson lifted the gun with a shaking fist. His other hand clutched a dark stain on his side.\n\n\"He's lost a lot of blood,\" Ghost said, its Light spilling across the scene.\n\n\"You were one 'a them all along,\" Judson sneered.\n\nThe man chuckled. \"All my lives, brother.\"\n\n\"You got us killed, you son of a—\"\n\nThe man kicked the firearm out of Judson's hand with no urgency at all. He knelt down to point a finger. \"No, no, that one's on you. Those Warlords caught you. What else were they gonna do? I wanted to stop you from leaving, but I didn't think I had the right.\"\n\nJudson reached out to grab his throat. The man caught his hand in a vice-grip instead, a crushing handshake. Judson frowned and struggled, but he was exhausted. Dying. And the man had strength that belied his frame.\n\nThe man lifted his other hand, smoldering from a Solar glow, and held it against Judson's wound. His former friend managed a high-pitched wail, but couldn't break the man's grip, though he tried and tried.\n\nThe man nodded at Judson, addressing his Ghost. \"Do you see how he never gives up? Because he knows this one life is all he has? No fear.\"\n\n\"Those Risen out there?\" The man finished cauterizing the wound and used his suddenly-cool hand to wave indiscriminately into the darkening night. \"They'd be long dead if they were him. All they know is war. This man survives.\"\n\nJudson made a gurgling sound. He had stopped struggling, but the man kept a grip on his hand.\n\n\"You wanted me to save him? Even if this works, he could never show me how to live. Not like he lives. And that's on you.\"\n\nGhost watched, but made minute adjustments to his orbiting armor and sent Light-based scans cascading across the ruins of town. If there were lingering Warlords or Iron Lords nearby, they would have to run.\n\nThe man stood up. Judson was dead.\n\n\"Maybe you should have told him you were bringing livestock in from a hundred leagues away and releasing them for him to catch,\" Ghost said.\n\n\"I mean—did you see how happy he was? How they all were? They got to eat,\" the man replied. \"Give someone something to chase and you give them purpose.\"\n\n\"You're pathetic. This is what you aspire to be? A perennial liar who plays house with refugees? These people are dead because of us!\"\n\n\"I lived here as one of them.\"\n\n\"You could be so much more. Let me show you how powerful your Light can become.\"\n\nThe man walked past his Ghost and brought Judson's corpse to the center of town. As he began digging again, he noticed the bloated, spherical husk that dominated the sky. It had been out of his life for a while, but it seemed a lot closer to earth tonight.\n\nHe raised a hand to salute it with a single finger, as Ghost looked on.\n\n\"How you livin'?\" he said, and gave a smile to the heavens that ended at his eyes.","name":"Home, pt.

Not because he provided a menu particularly suited to them, but because he had built his bar at the foot of a mountain called Felwinter Peak.\n\nFelwinter was a former Warlord—the only one, it was said, to hold an entire mountain all by himself. He now rode with the Iron Lords, and Felwinter Peak was staunchly the territory of the Iron Wolves. They had never given Wu permission to build the bar.\n\nHe had never asked.\n\nAlmost to a person, the patrons tonight were without Ghosts. High winds and inhospitable cold meant those without Ghosts rarely visited. But tonight, word had reached the general population that Warlords were back in the region. No shots had been fired. Not yet. But it was enough to get every poor, Lightless wretch from miles around into Wu's bar, where chances were an Iron Lord or Lady might be having a drink. Wu Ming didn't mind.\n\nThe door swung open again, and a trio of armored figures marched in from the cold. \"Welcome to the End of the World,\" greeted the serving frame. The Warlords shouldered past the 55-30 and headed straight for Wu Ming at the counter.\n\n\"What can I get you?\" Wu asked, giving a smile that ended at his eyes.\n\nThe leading Warlord, a hulking man with shoulder guards larger than his brain, grunted, \"Food. Everything you have.\" \n\nWu raised an eyebrow. \"Sure. That'll be... well, a lotta Glimmer.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" the giant man said, grabbing Wu by the lapels of his stormcoat. \"Give us everything you have in the back, or we'll gut you and eat you alive.\"\n\n\"Hey Citan,\" a woman's voice said. \"Pick on someone your own size.\"\n\nAll eyes turned to a helmeted figure standing a few feet behind Citan. She only came up to the giant man's sternum.\n\n\"Lady Efrideet,\" Citan muttered.\n\nWu Ming's gaze went from the Iron Lady to the three Warlords positioned around the bar amongst his Lightless patrons. He cursed under his breath and braced to duck.","name":"Loose Ends, pt.

Felwinter's lost his mind siding with you lot.\"\n\nUnderneath the helm, Citan's eyes flickered from the Iron Lady to his Warlord ally positioned behind her. The flanking Warlord raised a massive hand cannon and thundered a bullet—\n\nDirectly into Citan's chest as Efrideet dropped to a knee. She swung her cannon to her right side with her left fist and let loose with a roaring double-tap behind her, shattering the rear Warlord's head. Wu Ming saw that she hadn't so much as looked.\n\nThe third Warlord's submachine weapon fired a spray of bullets that hammered the floor as Efrideet rolled. Wu cursed inwardly as wood splinters went flying all over the room. People screamed.\n\nBut it was already over. The third Warlord crumpled. Efrideet's solar knife had divided his head.\n\n\"Hold!\" the Lady barked, firing her cannon into the ceiling as three Ghosts materialized above their charges. Bits of wood fell on her shoulder. Wu Ming cursed audibly this time.\n\n\"You know who I am,\" she shouted at the room. \"At this distance, I could shoot all of you out of the air swifter than you could ever bring your Risen back.\"\n\nThe Traveler's children froze, their shells spinning aggressively in the air like metallic bees.\n\n\"You're free to go,\" she told them. \"But your Risen stay with me. Follow the Iron Decree and you'll get them back. In time.\" The Ghosts looked at one another.\n\n\"Tell the Warlords,\" she sneered. \"Felwinter Peak belongs to the Wolves.\"\n\nThe Ghosts left the way their owners came. The bar patrons began murmuring.\n\nEfrideet's Ghost, always a quick thinker, started playing music: Lady Skorri singing an old hymn.\n\nThe patrons backed away from the three Warlord bodies, but began chattering amongst themselves. The din of conversation gradually filled the room and built to a dull roar. The music helped.\n\n\"Is this why you asked me here?\" Efrideet said, holstering her weapon. \"You said you had some business that paid.\"\n\n\"I did. You just finished it,\" he responded, reaching out with a fistful of Glimmer. The Iron Lady stared down at it, gawking beneath her helmet.\n\n\"Who the hell pays you?\"\n\n\"I have means,\" Wu Ming said, chuckling. \"Stick with me, sister. I'll make you rich. I promise.\"\n\nShe eagerly took the sapphire cubes out of his hand. Glimmer represented pure material potential.\n\n\"You didn't bring Felwinter,\" Wu said.\n\nShe eyed him. \"I told you he never comes down from the Peak unless it's official Iron Lord business. What do you need from him?\"\n\n\"Hey, what're you doing later?\" Wu asked suddenly.\n\n\"Hunting Fallen. They're becoming a problem at Boyle Pass. We'll be at it 'til dusk,\" Efrideet said, lifting the helmet just above her mouth to grab a drink from behind the counter and swallow an entire mug of the malt Wu served. She belched and asked, \"Care to join us?\" Her smile just beneath the helm was all teeth.\n\nWu chuckled. \"Nah, a mere mortal at a Risen fight? I'd just get in the way.\" He thought for a second. \"Would you like to dance before you go?\"\n\n\"Nah,\" she said, imitating his tone. The helm came down.\n\nHe cocked his head over the music, then leaned in to ask, \"Wait, what did you think I said?\"\n\n\"Would you like to dance before you go?\" she repeated.\n\n\"I would love to,\" he said, stepping forward, arms wide.\n\nShe side-stepped him and kicked his leg out from under him. He went tumbling to the ground, and someone spilled their drink on him.\n\n\"I had to try,\" he called from the floor, watching her go. The plume of her helmet rose above the crowd, and was already halfway out the door. \"Take the bodies!\" he yelled, still on the ground.\n\n**\n\nIt took him three hours to climb the Peak that night. He was shivering in his long coat, and if not for his Ghost, he would have succumbed to the cold long ago. Ghost was hidden, of course.\n\nThe massive castle doors were already open when he arrived at the top. An Exo, eyes glowing in its sleek black skull, stood just beyond them. It released whatever weapon it was reaching for inside its greatcoat when Wu Ming approached with his hands held high.\n\n\"I come in peace, brother.\"","name":"Loose Ends, pt.

Final-deaths. It's gotten real taboo recently. You Iron Lords are changin' things.\"\n\n\"Who are you?

His only friend in the world materialized out of the air.\n\n\"Is that supposed to impress me?\" Felwinter asked without a shred of irony. \"How else would you have survived the climb?\"\n\nWu coughed.

Will you kill for real?\"\n\n\"As a Warlord, I did many things I'm not proud of. Under the Iron Lords, I adhere to strict rules of engagement,\" Felwinter said. His voice sounded hollow inside his armored skin. \"Ghosts are not valid targets.\"\n\n\"I heard you care very much about right and wrong, and the delivery of justice to those who deserve it.\"\n\nFelwinter's eyes glowed brighter.\n\n\"I can't think of a more human act,\" he said after a moment's pause.\n\n\"I don't know that anyone has a right to that. But I believe in revenge with all my heart. And I have a request, knowing that you do what you do.\"\n\nFelwinter tapped his chin. \"What are you asking me?\"\n\nWu Ming told him a story about a long-forgotten town far away called Eaton, early in the age of Iron Lords. A Lord called Dryden had brought food for the town's starving people, but in return, asked to use them as bait to bring a local Warlord into position for an ambush. This, Wu had learned, went against the code set out by Lord Radegast, the founder of the order. Dryden had broken the rule of involving Lightless individuals in Iron Lord business, because it was those people the Lords had unified to protect. The town had agreed, of course. What choice did it have? But the ambush had gone horribly wrong. The Warlord target had brought a whole fireteam to the fight. Eaton's erasure was utter and complete. Though Wu later learned that Dryden won the battle, he lost every Lord under his command, Ghosts and all, and he committed the additional sin of inflicting final deaths on the Warlords he defeated, in an act of bloodlust and rage. In the intervening years, Wu had learned that Dryden kept this under wraps, and that he and his Ghost were now among the most decorated of Lords, next to the likes of rising champions like Lord Saladin and Lady Efrideet themselves.\n\nFelwinter sat frozen in his chair. It was difficult to tell if he had registered any of what Wu Ming had said.\n\n\"How do I know you're not lying?\" the hollow voice asked finally.\n\n\"I have live recordings,\" Wu replied. His Ghost transmitted a data stream to Felwinter's Ghost, who nodded.\n\n\"Eaton. Who were those people to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Just ghosts.\"\n\n\"You want revenge for people you care nothing about?\"\n\n\"Is the Darkhorse of Iron for hire?\"\n\nFelwinter stood, and politely motioned for Wu Ming to take his leave.\n\nWu sighed, shrugged, and left the chamber. He had a long climb ahead of him.\n\nThe Exo parted his coat and drew a long, bronze shotgun from his side.\n\n\"What do you think?\" his Ghost asked.\n\n\"Call Lord Dryden.

His huge horned armor lags his motions, like a weary companion trying to mimic everything he does. A servitor pumps ether into him. Lavinia wonders what would happen if she took Ether. Would she feel clearly and coldly determined? Would she turn into a huge Lavinia? Would she stop missing her home?\n\n\"Mara.\" Skolas's mouth was not made for that name. \"Mara, do you hear?\"\n\n\"The Queen of the Reef sentenced him to the fate of all Fallen,\" Lavinia's companion sighs. \"To strive, and struggle, and fail.

People think you are a fool. That you made an error releasing me. Led your people to die on my blade, as I led my people to die on yours.\"\n\nLavinia's translator murmurs along with the Kell's words. \"The Nine's agent never told me why he released me. Now I know. You know also, I think. Both of you require the Guardians... and the Nine do not understand life and death. So they sent me back to you, to make the Guardians come.

The doomed crew of the Dead Orbit scout ship Sophia called this place A113, an innocent catalogue number; they had no idea that the gates aboard—once a Golden Age experiment—had been captured by the Hive deity Crota. Those gates consumed them all.\n\nNow Crota is gone, and Lavinia has gambled everything that the portals have fallen into other hands. Ahamkara make the unreal real—Calus's ship is surrounded by a halo of unreal dark matter, like a ring of probing hands, Guardians can manipulate reality itself—there is a pattern here, a story, and it leads to Cocytus, to what these gates might do.\n\n\"Logs.\" She pages frantically through the observations left by the Awoken sentries once stationed here. Cocytus was abandoned when the Red Legion attacked, all its defenses scavenged to reinforce Vesta. \"What came out of the gate?

Over 72 hours, the emissions developed from diatomic hydrogen to nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, water, and simple organic molecules. At the 80-hour mark, a pellet of thick black hydrocarbon tar. Until 82:34:15, the gate emitted tar containing complex monomers and polymers—\n\n\"Come on!\" Lavinia barks, paging ahead. \"Come on, damn you, give me something real! Give me the Nine!\"\n\n//EVENT 1 TIME 524:03:11 Portal 3 emitted a living organism. Death was immediate. Autopsy team reports a spherical body, radius one point one meters, surfaced in hydrocarbon tar. Deep, evenly spaced \"throats\" converged on a central cavity perhaps intended to serve as lung and stomach. The body consists of an undifferentiated tissue of primitive cells. A basic spasm reflex forces air down the throats. Without enzymes to catalyze metabolism, the organism could not survive. Cell death occurred instantaneously throughout the mass. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\nLavinia reads this again, horrified and fascinated. Something on the far side of the gate is learning to assemble atoms, molecules, even haphazard life... something from a world of darkness and dust, probing its way into our structured existence, trying to cobble together a message, an emissary, a body...\n\nThe Nine are on the far side of this gate. She's sure of it. She's found them.\n\nBut to meet the Nine directly... would that be madness? Would there be any return? Would she ever see the City again?\n\nShe's come so far for her truth.\n\nAn alarm sounds in her helmet. INCOMING TRANSMAT, the suit warns her. INCOMING TRANSMAT. Her radio barks at her, stern as Ikora Rey: \"Cryptarch Lavinia Garcia Umr Tawil.\" It's Paladin Rior. \"You stand in violation of the Queen's law. Surrender yourself, and you will be treated fairly.\"\n\nLavinia stares into the yawning gate. Beyond it lies a realm of utter darkness and dissolution, a place where nothing exists except the most alien forms. To go there would be suicide. She would die like the poor tarball creature.\n\nBut what lies behind her? Failure? Surrender? Shame?

It is the hardest thing in the universe for the dust to make a loop at all, because, like a gust of wind or a river, it was only meant to move one way. For a mind to function, the end of one thought must alter the beginning of the next: so, like rivers, like wind, the Nine could not have minds until they could make loops.\n\nLavinia Garcia Umr Tawil comprehends the Nine.\n\nThey were already ancient when the first human beings named themselves. Their flesh was older than stars: the dark dust wind that blows through the galaxy, pinched by the gravity of Sol and its planets, drawn into their cores and exhaled again.\n\nThese were the Nine.\n\nIn time loops did form. Great arcs of outbound dust collapsed back to their sources to create circuits of shadow. The thickening and thinning of these circuits were the first thoughts of the Nine. They dwelt in massive indifference, unborn primordial gods. There was no force among them except gravity; no structure except the distribution of mass. Their hearts were in the cores of worlds, but their farthest streams faded out into the turn of the galaxy.\n\nThey were the fountains of Achlys, the night before chaos.\n\nBut life arose on the worlds at the heart of the Nine, tiny complicated motions of ecosystems and metabolisms and computations. That life left mass-shadows in the wind of the Nine, plucking at them like harp strings. From these trembles of structure the Nine learned to seed enormous resonating waves, thoughts vaster than worlds.\n\nSo the Nine awoke. And in time they understood that they were as fragile as they were mighty; for if the life that seeded their thoughts ever passed away, they too would vanish.\n\nThey had no eyes to catch light. They had no ears to hear. And yet they turned their wills upon the alien world of Matter, and strove to learn, for they knew they had to protect their hearts, or die.\n\nWith a horror of revelation so absolute that it would drive her mad if she still had sanity to lose, Lavinia understands where the Nine have always been. They are within everyone, every system, every living and moving thing. Trillions and pentillions of slim dark matter tentacles plunged through all our bodies, drinking up the complexity of our lives and thoughts.\n\nWe are all pinched silhouettes impaled on the twitchings of infinitely long spiderlegs.","name":"The Nine","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/165c2e753b9ef64b2b9046ce8211840c.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3891297049,"index":958,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3891297048":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Came now the Traveler, and with it a strange hope—for the Traveler's Light had the power to cause without causation! If the Nine had the Light, they could seed their own minds, free themselves from the dependence on matter-life! They could gain forces beyond Gravity to structure themselves, and so become more than wraiths of dark dust. They could enter the mad alien superworld of our chemical reality.\n\nSo they turned to this new hope... and were divided.\n\n\"Come to me,\" a voice calls to Lavinia, although there is nowhere to go, nothing to be, not even emptiness but the absence of anything to be empty or full. Lavinia perceives, without emotion, that she now exists as a structure of dark dust, a sandstorm blowing against itself.\n\n\"Come,\" the voice calls. \"I am Nasya. You are not safe. Come with me.\"\n\nNot safe?\n\nNo. Of course she is not safe. Because there are factions among the Nine: one faction sent Xûr and Orin to study Guardians and the Light, to seek the secret of effect-without-cause and to protect the source of that secret, the last source, now that the Ahamkara are gone. Those five played at alchemy with the Cocytus gates, turning dark dust into energy and then into matter, but they could not unlock the secrets of our mad existence. They needed ambassadors. Go-betweens.\n\nThe other faction walks a different path. A path of folds and needles slipped through spacetime itself, existential syringes yielding new spaces, to be remade as the Nine desire. They have tried to gather enough dark dust in one place to form a black hole, and found it difficult: when the dark mass collapses in gravity's fist, the dust passes through itself and scatters.\n\nBut difficult is not impossible. And there is far, far more dark matter in the universe than bright. They will find a way to make new worlds of it. They will end their dependence on life, and on the Light of Guardians, which the falling veil will soon snuff out forever...\n\nIn passing, Lavinia sees the entire history of the Queen's interactions with the Nine: more than anyone suspected, and more vital. She sees how one of the Nine blinded Guardians to Ghaul's approach, risking everything (for Ghaul would have destroyed the sun, and the Nine with it) to learn how to steal the Light. She sees how that one was punished.\n\n\"Come!\" Nasya calls, urgently. \"Come with me!

Fallen armed forces continue to fall back from active fronts across Terra. Factions of House Dusk remain active in the European Dead Zone. Throughout the rest of the globe, refugee attack incidents have dropped by more than 70% since the conclusion of the Red War—largely attributable to depressed Fallen and human populations rather than any significant change in interspecies relations.\n\n2. In absence of any united leadership, House Dusk continues to splinter and radicalize.\n\nThe recent trending emergence of so-called \"crime syndicates\" (cf. report #004-FALLEN-SIV) is emblematic of the continuing destructuralization of Fallen society. Likely an artifact of multi-generational colonization of human strongholds, this agent believes that because these syndicates have no relation to indigenous Fallen culture, young Fallen are appropriating and imitating human mythology in absence of a strong cultural heritage of their own.\n\nMuch like the dissolution of the Kell/Archon theology, this is positive news for those interested in the complete extirpation of invasive Fallen from the system.\n\n3. That being said, we should continue to monitor reunification efforts. Several personalities have emerged as potential leaders. First, the would-be integrationists:\n\nVIP #1121, well-known to Guardians of the inner system as Variks, or Variks the Loyal. Directly responsible for the release of the murderer Uldren Sov from the Prison of Elders, #1121 subsequently fled Awoken holdings in the Reef and now styles himself the Kell of Kells, still representing House Judgement. The Praxic Order has petitioned the Vanguard for permission to detain #1121. The Awoken monarchy, acting through the Queen's Wrath, has claimed jurisdiction over #1121 and further stated that any prosecution in absence of their involvement will be considered an act of war. The Vanguard has not yet made a statement about their position on the issue.\n\nVIP #3987, another former confederate of the Awoken, is a lesser-known personality known as Mithrax. Scattered field reports suggest that like #1121, #3987 styles himself a Kell of the so-called \"House Light,\" an otherwise unknown House apparently founded by #3987 himself. We have secondhand accounts that Mithrax has engaged in allied operations with Guardians in the field, though we have not as yet been able to corroborate these accounts with any degree of veracity. This agent is inclined to treat these reports with a healthy degree of skepticism until otherwise confirmed, as they may be propaganda from Fallen sympathizers in the Old Russian and Red War Guardian cohorts. We have requested intelligence records from the Awoken which may further clarify the matter.\n\nIn addition, whatever the findings of said intelligence records may be, it should be stressed that one or two sympathetic outliers cannot be relied upon to erase the wrongs of past centuries, nor should their good-faith efforts to correct the sins of their forebears be taken as sufficient symbolic reparation.\n\nSecond, the would-be separatists:\n\nVIP #4503, a recent personality known as Fikrul, or the Fanatic. A close confederate of the murderer Uldren Sov, #4503 has the apparent ability to raise himself from the dead in a manner not dissimilar to Ghost-aided resurrection. Though his reign on the Tangled Shore was limited, he possesses sufficient skill, hatred, and motive to warrant on-going surveillance. Given #4503's propensity for resurrection, the inherent risk of #4503 reclaiming the body of the murderer Uldren Sov from his final resting place in the Dreaming City goes without saying. The Vanguard continues to deploy fireteams to suppress #4503; our agents have reached out to the Cryptarchy and the Gensym Scribes to request guidance as to his permanent destruction.\n\nVIP #2029, a once-known personality known as Eramis, or Eramis, the Shipstealer. A House Devils Baroness incarcerated during the Wolf Wars, #2029 successfully fled the Prison of Elders during the mass escape orchestrated by #1121. #2029 is a classical Fallen pirate of the old ways: vicious, uncompromising, and possessing cunning of the highest degree. Field reports indicate that she is rallying violent dissidents to reconstruct House Devils from the ground up. This agent believes her to be the most viable candidate for universal Fallen reunification, and would urge the Vanguard and other interested leadership to aggressively prioritize her destruction.\n\nWe have come too far to pull our punches now.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Outliers","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507760,"index":969,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507763":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 1021-CITY-VAN\nAGENT(S): IKO-006\nSUBJ: Instability of leadership\n\n1. Following the events of the Red War and the recent loss of the Hunter Vanguard, current acting Vanguard leadership has struggled to define its function and role within what is an otherwise largely egalitarian and self-governing body of active Guardians. Much like the current popular perception of the Awoken queen, we have failed to adequately respond to questions about our integrity, competence, and unity as we have grieved the loss of the Hunter Vanguard.\n\nThe Vanguard was never intended as a governing body of authoritarians, nor does it function as such, but in times of turmoil and uncertainty, people rightly look to figures of strength for guidance and support. Neither the Titan Vanguard nor I ever intended to become politicians. We are warriors, first and foremost, and we no longer feel that we are able to serve as such.\n\nIn the spirit of honest self-reflection in the face of justified skepticism, we have begun to discuss the possibility of stepping down to invite new leadership into our place, as well as the general merits of disbanding the Vanguard entirely—largely because we believe that this crisis of identity will plague anyone who steps into this role. We recognize that this is ill-timed, and we will endeavor to involve the Consensus, the Guardians themselves, and all other interested parties in the discussion as appropriate. I specifically invite the Hidden to closely monitor the situation without my involvement. Should you agree that we are doing more harm than good, please do not hesitate to take whatever actions you agree are necessary.\n\n2. Regarding the open Hunter Vanguard position and the terms of Cayde's Dare: The situation is unprecedented. Were we to trace the chain of culpability back to its first link, I believe we would be obligated to elect a Hive god to our council.\n\nOur current inclination is to caucus with the Hunters to debate the benefits of opening the position to any interested and well-qualified Hunter. Such a debate is, of course, contingent upon the continued existence of the Vanguard itself. We will make an effort to convene the Hunters as soon as possible, but this group should be well aware that most credible candidates have fled the Tower in anticipation of such a debate.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Instability","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507763,"index":970,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507762":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 002-A899OF-COC\nAGENT(S): TRU-135\nSUBJ: Intercepted transmission\n\nSENSITIVE!! – CONTENTS BELOW SNIFFED FROM ENCRYPTED REEF DATACOMS – SENSITIVE!!\n\n1. We are maintaining our containment posture at Cocytus. I assess no immediate danger to the system, and we have enough firepower to destroy the station and its mechanisms remotely if the on-site warheads fail. The station remains in the stable heliocentric orbit where it was parked after the destruction of Ceres.\n\n2. I do not ask confirmation of these theories, and in fact I beg you not to address them. But I have reviewed the site records, and the fate of the Sophia's crew after they were herded to Cocytus stinks of Hive madness. The Cocytus apertures must—at the time—have opened into a Hive manifold associated with Crota. Whatever their original purpose, when Crota established his presence in the system, they became conduits into hell... and the Sophia crew's ugly end proved it. Whoever drove the Sophia to its doom then installed the Cocytus Instruments around the original Golden Age facility to study Crota's manifold.\n\n3. Crota is dead. His hold on these gates has passed. Now something else is trying to pass through into our world... but it is so alien, and its sendings so bafflingly malformed, that I fear this can only end in madness.\n\n4. The first \"visitors\" through the third gate, at event time 00:00:00, were simple hydrogen atoms. Over the course of 72 hours, the emissions developed from diatomic hydrogen to nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, water, and simple organic molecules. At the 80-hour mark, we received our first macroscopic visitor, a pellet of thick black hydrocarbon tar. Until 82:34:15 the gate vomited tar containing increasingly complex monomers and polymers.\n\n5. The visitors then began to assume geometric form. A hail of cubes and hexagons, each built from molecular crystal of the same form as the whole. A series of fractal shapes that shattered under internal flaws. Several capsules or membranes of increasingly complex structure, containing water or oil. These may have been cellular precursors.\n\n6. At 524:03:11 a living organism appeared. Death was immediate. Remote dissection describes a spherical body, radius approximately one meter, surfaced in thick hydrocarbon tar. Deep, evenly spaced \"throats\" converged on a central cavity perhaps intended to serve as lung and stomach. The body exhibited undifferentiated tissue of primitive plantlike cells, capable of spasming to pump air or fluid in and out of the throats. Without enzymes to catalyze metabolism, or internal structure to dispose of waste, the organism could not survive. Cell death occurred almost instantaneously throughout the mass. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n7. At 690:29:54 the gate emitted a tubular organism. For ninety seconds the organism moved across the gate chamber by contracting and expanding, then expired. Remote dissection describes a two-meter-long body with a spinal cavity full of energy-rich carbohydrate fluid. The organism's contractions forced this fluid through a capillary network, where simple cells catabolized the carbohydrates into energy to power further contractions. The buildup of heat and waste quickly denatured the enzymes required for metabolism, and the organism died. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n8. The gate has remained inactive since, barring short emissions of molecules which may be experimental proteins. Remote drones have registered similar ambient molecules within the Hellmouth on Luna, though we have been unable to identify their source. We will maintain the quarantine until otherwise instructed.\n\nThe overwhelming impression I have is one of learning, of increasing sophistication in the synthesis and arrangement of matter. The atoms in these structures were isotopically pure and impossible to date, but I have the uncomfortable sense that even they were freshly made.\n\n9. Probes and instruments dispatched through the third gate do not return. Annihilation is apparently immediate, and so total that it seems to result from a fundamental failure of the ability to exist rather than any weapon or countermeasure. Yet something does exist on the far side, and it is trying to learn the rules of our world from very first principles.

Although Ghaul's campaign made no real provision for continued resistance after the Traveler was contained and the Almighty moved into firing position, his opening gambit achieved a level of strategic surprise that would be the envy of any ancient general. Psion electronic warfare units compromised the City's sensor perimeters and suppressed our satellite early warning systems (so thoroughly that they even maintained their failsafe signals until the last possible moment). An extraordinary deception program in the Prison of Elders, combined with relativistic projectile strikes against key sensors, blinded the Reef to a simultaneous attack.\n\nBut how did the Red Legion escape the notice of the entire scattered Dead Orbit fleet? It would be politically unwise to suggest that the Arachs withheld information so their precious ships would be spared a losing battle... and indeed, the integrity of that same fleet proved invaluable in the counterattack and the city's reconstruction. It would be even more politically incendiary to suggest that the Future War Cult viewed the City's brief occupation as politically useful (or, more charitably, as a necessary step towards some desirable future timeline).\n\nBut it is impossible not to ask: how did the same Guardians who foresaw Oryx in prophecy (and in captured enemy material) fail to anticipate and take measures against the Red Legion attack? Is there something intrinsically more secular, and thus unforeseeable, about the Cabal? Do they practice superior information security to the Hive—unlikely, given the interception of a Cabal distress signal in the wake of the Taken War?\n\nDid some agency, henceforth unknown, act to conceal Ghaul's approach from our protectors? One that shared with Ghaul some central motive—whether the destruction of the Guardians, the capture of the Traveler, or the apprehension by force of the abilities we call the Light?\n\nIf such an agency exists, capable of such totality and subtlety in its action, how has it concealed itself from us?\n\n3. If I didn't know better, I'd say we had a leak. Hassan's a real ringer. Hope he gets rezzed as one of us when he dies.\n\n4.

These missives were sent via Glimmer, using a simple encryption scheme that even a 55-30 unit Frame could have easily cracked. #2014's Ghost took immediate notice of these messages and quietly forwarded them on to IKO-006, who then distributed them back to us. Cf. reports #167-173-VESTA-DC for full transcripts.\n\n2. In these messages, the sender briefly purports to be none other than one ERI-223, providing fanciful details regarding her origins as a human woman who grew up in an apparent settlement of Old Russia known as St. Petersburg. None of this account sat well with anyone who actually knows ERI-223—not simply because none of her close confederates had any firsthand knowledge or belief that she knew of her pre-Guardian origins, but also because she is still active in the field and has personally denied sending these messages. That being said, in accordance with our rigor for skeptical inquiry, this agent was dispatched in pursuit of hard evidence to the contrary.\n\n3. I submit to you now photographic and video evidence recovered from civilian family albums, historical archives, and extant Ghost recordings originally captured in the Last City. Behold, ERI-223: a child of the Last City, born to civilian parents in a mortal-Guardian integrated neighborhood. Behold, too, tiny VIP #1786—though he is almost more unbelievable than ERI-223, if you look at his smile.\n\nOf the photos, original digital files are unavailable, but radiocarbon dating clearly identifies the earliest prints as more than three hundred years old. This is consistent with the timestamps of footage provided by volunteer Ghosts who were present during the same period. As to whether the child we believe to be ERI-223 is indeed ERI-223, please see the second compressed folder attached to this report for full double-blind forensics.\n\n4. In regards to the other personality presented in the six messages: Having consulted with AI-COM/RSPN and AI-COM/XBLK, both have attested that they have no record of any so-called craftmind designated Medusa. This does not discount the possibility that such a craftmind may have existed, but in light of the fact that someone was impersonating our former colleague, it follows that someone may have credibly invented a craftmind as well. We will continue to scour our records for any evidence to the contrary.\n\n5. Like many of those reading, this agent has a strong recommendation about the identity of the sender, but it is beyond the scope of this report. Cf. reports #024-VESTA-DC, 025-VESTA-DC, #026-VESTA-DC, #086-VESTA-DC, #001-034-HIVE-SAV, and #001-005-HIVE-DUL.\n\n6. Given the importance of #2014's contributions to our defense efforts as well as the recent downfall of the Awoken prince, this agent is deeply troubled by the idea that a malicious entity might seek to sway or confuse #2014 through the context of trusted allies. #2014's Ghost made brief mention of some kind of waking hallucination in one of its messages. Have we reached out to corroborate that report or provide additional counsel?\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Forgeries","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507764,"index":973,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507767":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 059-CABAL-LEV\nAGENT(S): TRU-135\nSUBJ: Sitrep\n\n1. Live-fire training exercises continue at the active incursion site on the Leviathan. No further RAID class operations have been documented since the unauthorized intervention against VIP #4044 at the explicit invitation of VIP #3801. This agent still believes that the Vanguard should institute stronger measures to prevent rogue teams from carelessly rushing to the aid of enemy VIPs – particularly given #3801's documented history of solicitous behavior and the tendency of our warriors to rush slack-jawed toward free gifts. #4044 could have been a useful catspaw in the destruction of #3801. We should not have intervened.\n\n2. Related to the above, #3801's aggressive propaganda campaign appears to have been successful. Despite #3801's recent inactivity, sentiment polls captured in the Tower at regular intervals over the last several months indicate that he has successfully swayed a significant percentage of the Red War cohort to believe that he may be a potential ally. Given our history with the Cabal as well as the events of the Red War itself, this is shocking and perhaps attributable to a case of mass traumatic bonding.\n\nIt is my strong recommendation that the Vanguard pursue a reeducation curriculum before #3801 invites any Guardians of the City to defect to his service, a possibility which we have documented in multiple previous reports.\n\n3. Nessus continues to remain stable, likely due to Vex machinoforming.\n\n4. The Awoken armada continues regular shows of force. The Leviathan remains non-hostile.\n\n5. Our agents continue to closely monitor inbound and outbound traffic to and from the Leviathan. As yet, we have not been able to observe any non-Guardian transport, providing additional evidence for the fact that the ship is either a self-contained ecosystem which has no paracausal exits or that it possesses some kind of internal stargate network by which occupants may invisibly enter and exit. As the Cabal have no documented history of such stargates, we are inclined to believe the former.\n\n6. In summary, there is no real news. However, this agent is inclined to regard this conspicuous passivity with suspicion rather than relief, and would urge Vanguard leadership to consider exploratory excursions in coming months.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Passivity","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507767,"index":974,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507766":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 12059-INCID-LUN\nAGENT(S): FEN-092\nSUBJ: Affidavit regarding Incident #12059\n\n1. Last week, I was deployed by IKO-006 for routine surveillance of the quarantined zone outside the Hellmouth. Hive populations remain low and grow ever lower thanks to the efforts of a small contingent of veteran Guardians who have made their homes on Luna.\n\n2. Around 1900 hours yesterday afternoon, I began to experience a crushing headache and excused myself from patrol to recuperate. Though I originally intended to lay down for a nap, I fell asleep instead, and experienced multiple vivid dreams over the next 11.5 hours. In all of these dreams, I was trying to catch up with agent ERI-223 in a crowd. She was always out of reach, whether by 200 m or 20 m. I had the sense that I needed to speak to her.\n\n3. When I woke, I found that my headache had not improved. I prepared my armor and exited my bivouac to find a single stationary Thrall crouched nearby. It stood as I approached, but made no motion to attack me. I fired one shot, killing it immediately. Upon stepping forward to examine its corpse, I saw a solid black fragment of an unknown material embedded in its chest cavity. The fragment resembled a flake or a shard of some larger object, not dissimilar to a high-gain photovoltaic panel.\n\n4. I requested that my Ghost perform a standard material analysis of the fragment but neither one of us could confidently identify its qualities or provenance; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #1.\n\n5. I requested that my Ghost attempt to contain and transmat the fragment for quarantine on my jumpship. He was unable to establish a Light link with the object, describing the fragment as \"slippery\" and \"tiring\" to try to catch hold of.\n\n6. I used the barrel of my sniper rifle to touch and then work the fragment out of the Thrall's corpse. Using my rifle, I turned the fragment over and examined it from multiple angles. I requested that my Ghost run another deep scan of the object; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #2.\n\n7. We concluded that the material seemed to be inert and that it did not seem to be part of any complex device or mechanism.\n\n8. At this point, I broke protocol and did not request additional backup. Instead, I picked up the fragment by hand and immediately experienced a vivid hallucination: I stood over VIP #0704's  shoulder as she dressed a seven-inch gash on agent ERI-223's thigh. Both #0704 and ERI-223 were dressed for combat. Hundreds of fragments of the unknown material hung in the air around us, apparent shrapnel from the wreckage of a nearby ship of unrecognizable make and model. ERI-223 looked directly toward me and said, \"Патетическая.\"\n\n9. The duration of the hallucination was approximately seven seconds. At its conclusion, my headache disappeared. My Ghost and I held our position for the next thirty minutes, then collected the body of the Thrall and the fragment for transportation. I delivered myself and my cargo to quarantine and experienced no further mental disturbances while detained.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Fragment","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507766,"index":975,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507769":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 045-VIP-1315\nAGENT(S): IKO-006\nSUBJ: Leased space in the Annex\n\n1. After several months of negotiation, the Vanguard has agreed to allow VIP #1315 to formally lease an unused warehouse space in the Annex of the new Tower. To be clear, this was the Vanguard's proposal, not his. Despite the many skeptics who have good questions about the social risk inherent in providing #1315 with a more legitimate space, we feel that any disruption of morale or Tower culture will be short-term and minimal.

It is my belief that his presence will do more good than ill, and that the Tower has long stunted its own growth through narrow-minded fear and reactive exile of dissidents. We should endeavor to remain sharp skeptics of philosophies which differ from our own, but we should always be willing to hear and consider these philosophies.\n\nFurther: any concerned members of the Praxic Order should recall that the Vanguard holds jurisdiction over their actions, and that the exile of dissident philosophers is very different from the exile of rogue operators.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Lease","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507769,"index":976,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507768":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 053-VIP-1315\nAGENT(S): AUN-326\nSUBJ: Psych eval\n\n1. THIS DATA OBTAINED FROM SURVEILLANCE DEVICES AT 1315-HOME2.\n\n2. In previous reports, I stated that it was my belief that #1315 had invoked some kind of paracausal event enabling the resurrection and return of enemy VIP #2015. This belief was predicated upon reports of creatures resembling the infamous \"Echoes of Oryx\" that Guardian forces engaged and destroyed en masse during the Taken War (cf. Ghost-stream footage here: CATHEDRAL.OF.DUSK.DREADNAUGHT).\n\nThis has proven false. Spectral analysis from multiple Ghosts participating undercover in Prime and Reckoning confirms that the impossible world at the heart of \"the haul\" is located in unknown space. (Cf. REP #001-012-PARAC-NINE.) Further, these Primevals differ in their literal elemental composition: low SNC, high ambient ΛCDM. #1315 has harnessed his \"banks\" to what appears to be an engine of pure potential. He no longer needs to pilfer the Ascendant Plane of Primevals, the oldest Taken in residence. He can create Primeval-likes from the energy of \"the haul\" and sheer force of will. As to the apparent presence of #2015, it is a falsehood. My handlers in the Praxic Order surmise simply: the shape of Oryx was the scariest Hive he could think of. He's tenacious, but he has a small mind.\n\n3. Highly recommend we assess #1315 for the influence of paracausal forces or entities. Since the conclusion of the joint Vanguard/Praxic investigation into his operations, the subject has become increasingly erratic. Beyond running his Gambit and Reckoning drills with the Guardian population, he has done nothing but hole up in the Annex. He has always exhibited the signs of stress related to prolonged solitude that are typical of all surviving Risen; this manifests in the subject in prolonged and rambling conversations with either himself or his as-yet-unseen Ghost. However, his musings have become less and less coherent over time. Late into the night, away from the Guardian cohorts, he yells at voices that our surveillance equipment has never picked up. He has spoken to himself about trips across vast, interstellar distances to realms no Guardian has ever described.\n\nAgain, he has not left the Annex in ages. One might say that I am overstepping even Praxic boundaries here, but I would say to them: the subject is free to leave any time.\n\n4. Following the results of my investigation, the subject has ceased regular reports to Lord Shaxx. I'm sure both prefer it that way. #1315 has broken none of the Vanguard's decrees in that time, nor have any further Guardians perished on his watch in Gambit or Reckoning. He is still a facilitator to murder and a thief, but he has done nothing to warrant eviction, as I had hoped. The Vanguard obviously still needs him.\n\n5.

She carries in her knapsack an unopened letter from her brother, her mother's ashes, a selection of seeds and cuttings from her favorite neighborhood trees and plants, and some thirty thousand songs and short videos on a hand-me-down myoelectric augment.\n\nOn the ship's manifest, Nasya Sarwar is one of two dozen classless Scopares, trash collectors and composters and caretakers devoted to endlessly tidying the many surfaces and people within the Yang Liwei that cannot or do not clean themselves. She hopes through hard work and perseverance, she will prove herself worthy of one of the ship's remaining civilian cryopods, or—even better—a promotion to an Auturge position where she believes she'll find the freedom to devote her waking hours entirely to the loving care of the ship's hydroponics facilities.\n\nNasya is quadrilingual. Several of her fellow Scopares are not: born monolinguals who got lucky in international Exodus lotteries, just like she did. When they realize that she can speak to some of them, they do their best to befriend her. They share meals. They show her photos of the loved ones they left behind. They explain the function of the ship's many impossible machines. In turn, she does her best to teach them how to speak to the others. In this way, they are all a little less alone.\n\nShe is twenty-seven years old.\n\n\n2.\n\nOn the day she awakens in the Distributary, she names herself Nasan Ar. She carries in her hands a small silver jar. A dent has crushed its lid; it is impossible to open. She does not know its provenance, but she feels an inexplicable tugging of grief in her chest when she thinks about walking on without it.\n\nShe makes herself a home under the largest tree she can find. In the early days, it is little more than a lean-to and a campfire, but she shares it willingly with whoever passes by. Her guests help her transform the lean-to into a proper cottage with several guest beds. One cottage becomes two, then two is three, until three becomes a village.\n\nNasan loves her guests and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become mother or mayor. Whenever they gather in the evening for dinner, she feels claustrophobic anxiety press tight around her. She is shackled to the earth by all these people that she loves, and she has no words to explain her own restlessness. She feels monstrous. Why doesn't she love this? Why doesn't she want to stay?\n\nOne clear night, amid the honey-heavy smell of spring flowers and recent rain, she takes her silver jar and goes out into the dripping dark.\n\n\n3.\n\nShe wanders. She tries on lives like she is trying on city-tailored fashions: for a few weeks, she is a Corsair. Then for a whole summer, she is a field hand. When she tires of that, she balances books for an atom merchant who trades in radioactive materials. Nothing holds her. Seeing her silver jar, one man suggests she may be a treasure hunter. The idea sends her deep into a subterranean cavern where she finds no treasure, but instead bioluminescent worms and a Paladin who calls herself Sjur Eido.\n\n\"If you're looking for a job,\" Sjur says, \"I should introduce you to my boss.\"\n\n\n4.\n\nOn the day Nasan finds her calling, the Diasyrm styles her a translator. It confuses her, because the Speech is the Speech. Variations have developed over time, but none are so distant from each other that two Awoken from around the world cannot speak to each other. \"What do you mean?\" Nasan asks.\n\n\"Well,\" the Diasyrm says. \"I've been watching since you arrived. People look to you when they're fighting, and you try to understand each side before you try to help. When you speak, you do it deftly, without condescension.\" She considers Nasan. \"It seems to me that you lend people grace when you help them explain themselves.\"\n\nA little candle of pride flickers in Nasan's throat. \"That's just mediation,\" she says, glancing away.\n\n\"Don't sell yourself short. Anyone can break up a fight. Few people can so clearly grasp the spirit of a thought, then rephrase it so that deaf ears hear it. Gifts like that can end wars.\" Thinking on that, the Diasyrm sobers. \"We'll have to keep your talent to ourselves, for now. The Sanguine would just as soon cut out your tongue.\"\n\n\n5.\n\nThe Theodicy War is a fact of life until it isn't. The killing stops, but the wounds remain. Nasan helps the Awoken mend. Her friends urge her to speak publicly, to help people on a grander scale, but Nasan believes the most effective change happens in groups of fewer than ten.","name":"Seeds and Cuttings","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/cea968a40ffb450d042a4f56751aec00.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1164559471,"index":978,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1164559468":{"displayProperties":{"description":"6.\n\nShe is standing in a crowd of thousands when Mara Sov tells the Awoken about the dying world they abandoned.

She holds her silver jar to her forehead, focusing on its cool constant weight, and knows that she must leave.\n\n\n7.\n\nShe finds her old friend Sjur. Amid the feverish departure preparations, there is somehow time for an introduction to Mara. Nasan makes a pledge of herself and her skills. She will do what she can to convince those who might stay behind—\n\n\"No,\" Mara interrupts with the bite of unsweetened tea. \"I would not ask that of you or anyone else.\"\n\nNasan hesitates.\n\n\"Help those who have already made their choice, whatever it is. Help them with the grief.\" She clasps Nasan's hand. The stress around her eyes eases. \"That's more important.\"\n\n\n8.\n\nThe exodus is absolute in its terror. Nasan has never felt such a profound sense of schism—not when leaving lovers, nor communities, nor cherished hiding places.\n\nAs the Distributary shrinks behind their Hulls, she looks down at the little silver jar in her hands and wonders who she left behind in the world they're returning to protect. She wonders if they might still be alive.\n\n\n9.\n\nSjur is as plain and ready a companion as she ever was in the Diasyrm's camp, but Mara is an enigma. Nasan feels drawn to her, not by her porcelain beauty, but by her onion-skin layers of defense. There are so many different truths that ring through Mara's carefully chosen words: chords of nuanced meaning that she feels she might be able to separate out into cleaner notes for frightened minds craving simplicity.\n\nShe does what she can. In quiet hours and fragmented conversations, she becomes an unconventional counselor to the would-be queen.\n\nWhen the first fragile attempts at rebuilding society run afoul of the Long Unquiet Night, then the discovery of the Traveler and the Fallen, and then inevitably turn to riot and desertion, Nasan goes to Mara again to pledge her services. \"Let me go after them,\" she begs, not a day after the proclamation that they all hear in their skulls instead of their ears. \"I don't mean to change their minds or convince them to come back. I just—\"\n\n\"Then what DO you mean to do?\" Sjur asks curiously. Mara watches her with ageless patience, waiting for her to find the words.\n\nNasan purses her lips. \"I want them to understand that you are—that you—that you are good. That you aren't what they think.\" Seeing Sjur bristle, she holds up her hand. To her relief, Mara makes a slight warding gesture as well. \"And if they know that and still wish to live apart from us on Earth, that's fine. That's their choice.\"\n\n\"I don't need them to understand that,\" Mara says softly. There is the faintest husk of grief in her steady voice.\n\n\"No,\" Nasan agrees, relieved that Mara is willing to consider this truth. \"You don't. You have the courage to be disliked, and that is uncommon. But it is just as important, sometimes, to cultivate good will...\" Especially if you have forgotten what it feels like to not know everything, she thinks.\n\nMara looks away. Nasan watches closely and thinks that perhaps she has been heard. Sjur shifts her weight impatiently, tired by all this meaningful silence. It has been a long nineteen hours.\n\n\"If you go,\" Mara says finally, \"you cannot come back.\"\n\nNasan hears the truth in it. She reaches to clasp Mara's hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n10.\n\nSo she goes to Earth. She carries a survival kit, a hunting rifle, and the tarnished silver jar that has followed her through her whole existence.\n\nShe finds no Awoken as she wanders an empty prairie.

Along its grip, they've engraved the words I AM THE END OF ALL THINGS in tidy block print.\n\n\n16.\n\nShe meets a young woman whose skin looks like hers.\n\n\"Where did you come from?\" Orin asks, staring too hard, standing a little too close. It is impossible not to: every other blue-skinned person she has ever seen has either been dead or a distant figure hurrying for a gleaming ship.\n\nThe young woman cringes away from her. \"The Sinaloan ruins.\"\n\n\"Are there other people there like you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHearing her question, one of her friends pulls her aside to point up at the sky. \"Your people are up there,\" he says. \"They live among the asteroids.\"\n\n\"Why aren't they here?\" she asks, but he has no answer.\n\n\n17.\n\nThe everyday rhythm of the Pilgrim Guard suits her for decades: eradicate Warlords and alien invaders; protect mortal civilians; guide homeless refugees to safety. Their numbers wax and wane over time, but they are forever the watchers-in-the-dark, the living-shield-that-shelters, the ladder-which-humanity-will-climb-toward-rebirth. Inspiring campfire speeches are an endless fact of life, and they buoy her until she begins to recognize the leitmotifs of self-sacrificing heroism.\n\nOrin loves her leaders and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become soldier or symbol. Whenever they gather in the evening for dinner, she feels claustrophobic anxiety press around her. She is shackled to the wilds by all these people that she loves, and she has no words to explain her own restlessness. Alone on night watch, she tells Gol that she feels monstrous. Why doesn't she love this? Why doesn't she want to stay?","name":"War Hammer","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/cea968a40ffb450d042a4f56751aec00.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1164559466,"index":981,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1164559467":{"displayProperties":{"description":"18.\n\nThere are stories of a massive settlement in the far south. Rumors call it \"The Last Safe City,\" a place of peace and prosperity guarded by indestructible Old Russian warriors who fight alongside twenty-foot-tall wolves (whatever those are).\n\nThe Pilgrim Guard has heard of many so-called safe cities. They come and go, but mostly they go.\n\nStill, they reroute their caravan. The land down south is good: arable, temperate, and with too many indigenous parasites for the Fallen to wish it as a customary home. Even if there is no safe city there, it is a better place to guide civilians than the ravaged deserts and plains of the north.\n\nOrin hopes the rumors are true, but it is a selfish hope: If the city is real, and people are safe there, then maybe she can rest.\n\n\n19.\n\n\"City\" is a misnomer; it has been a misnomer since this place's inception. It is a chaotic sprawl of tents and shabby lean-tos. There is not a single permanent structure among them. The streets are nothing more than muddy pathways that smell of waste and smoke. But the people! Neither Orin nor Gol have seen so many people in all their lives.\n\nFilthy children scream with laughter as they play tag around salvaged tanks. A civilian militia stands vigil over cassava farmers. Armored Risen bicker over where they should mark the city's borders and how best to defend them.\n\nThe Traveler looms overhead as Orin wanders through it all, wide-eyed and exhilarated.\n\n\n20.\n\nThe Pilgrim Guard prepares to move out, provisioned to make an eighteen-month expedition through the far north. Orin stays behind. No one questions her decision, though they do grieve it. Each one of them cuts a notch into the grip of her war hammer until it reads I I I I I I I I I AM THE END OF ALL THINGS.\n\n\n21.\n\nThere are Awoken here in this safe city. They are uncommon, though Exos are even rarer. Most have Ghosts, as she does. A few do not, and it's these people that Orin is most fascinated by.\n\nShe dogs them with relentless patience, asking question after question: Where did you come from? Why have you come here? Where are the rest of us? Where did you get that gun? What are those bullets made out of? Why doesn't everyone have those bullets? Do people ever move to avoid you? Do you hear voices when you are alone? Are your dreams ever like omens?

His Hildian sustained damage during a dog-fight with a Fallen skiff, and now an important pump is leaking. He cannot find the source of the leak, nor does he have the supplies to repair it. The rest of the Awoken are at home, in the Reef.\n\nThe gun is a standard-issue Tigerspite AR; it uses cased telescoped rounds made of a proprietary plasteel-spinmetal blend. There are engineers hard at work on manufacturing techniques that will allow for widespread distribution of the weapon to Risen and civilian populations on Earth.\n\nPeople do avoid him. Earthborn and Risen Awoken almost never speak to him; he is surprised that she bothered. He does hear voices; he does have prophetic dreams. He describes it all in detail and she is shocked by how familiar it sounds. It is like listening to a recording of herself.\n\nAt her final question, he hesitates. He runs a grimy hand through his hair and looks up at the stars. They have been talking a long time. \"If we're going to talk some more,\" he says at last, \"we might as well have a drink.\"\n\n\n23.\n\nNamqi is not particularly tall, nor particularly handsome. Taken in isolation, parts of him are beautiful. His nose. His hands. The lines of his throat. The coruscating light that passes over his skin fascinates her; she watches to see if its patterns match her own. They do not.\n\nMost of all, Orin is struck by his ability to listen with empathy. He is quiet more often than not. Long silences don't frighten him. And when he speaks, he does it deftly, without condescension.\n\n\n24.\n\nIt takes eight weeks to repair the leaking pump. In that time, Orin convinces Namqi to break queenslaw and smuggle her and Gol beyond the Vestian Outpost. She is determined to understand why she revolted against her own people.\n\nThey are scarcely a half-day's burn toward Interamnia before they are intercepted by Galliots painted in the Queen's colors.\n\n\n25.\n\n\"Woof,\" Sjur Eido says when she sees Orin for the first time, \"Mara's gonna hate this.\" She crosses the detainment cell to get a better look at Gol. \"Figured this might happen eventually, but I'd always hoped...\" She pulls at the nape of her neck, then gives a little half-shrug: well, what can you do.\n\nTurning, she looks at Namqi. \"You know you broke the law, right?\"\n\nHe nods.\n\nShe claps him on the shoulder and smiles. \"My man.\"\n\n\n26.\n\nTwo Paladins deliver her to Mara Sov. Gol is not permitted in the court, nor is Namqi.\n\n\"I knew you,\" Orin says before Mara can speak. It is uncourtly etiquette, she supposes, but they are alone and she is too bold to fear offense.\n\n\"What do you remember?\"\n\nOrin gives a slight shake of her head. Moments pass. Mara, too, is comfortable with silence. Behind her mask of composed indifference, her eyes are sharp with curiosity.\n\n\"Why did I leave?\" Orin asks.\n\n\"You wished to be my emissary.\"\n\n\"And you banished me for it?\" She squints. \"That doesn't seem like something you'd do...\"\n\nMara smiles faintly. \"No.\"\n\n\n27.\n\nThey have several more conversations.\n\nThe revelations are absolute in their terror. Orin has never felt such a profound sense of schism—not when learning that most mortals would sooner swallow cyanide pills than come face-to-face with a Risen, nor that the Eliksni were once abandoned by the Traveler, nor that almost all Warlords are Lightbearers.\n\n\n28.\n\nBut the queenslaw is, of course, the queenslaw. It must be upheld—but the spirit of the law often differs from its letter.\n\nNamqi accepts a sentence of five years' indentured servitude to the crown for smuggling Orin into Reef holdings. They let him pick his detail and negotiate his salary.\n\nOrin's case is not so simple. She is not who she was, so after vigorous philosophical debate, it is decreed that she cannot be held accountable for her past oaths. But she engaged in witting trespass, aided and abetted by a learned civilian, and for that, she must sacrifice a boon: an unnamed future debt of the crown's choosing.\n\nOrin accepts the sentence gladly and returns to Earth to mend her wounds. She needs to think. She needs to talk.","name":"Queenslaw","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/cea968a40ffb450d042a4f56751aec00.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1164559464,"index":983,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1164559465":{"displayProperties":{"description":"29.\n\nIt seems everyone knows the Pilgrim Guard now.

She looks out at the Reef as she struggles to master herself.\n\nOrin imagines Namqi dead and clenches her war hammer a little tighter.\n\nAt last, Mara says, \"First, to know.\" She gives Orin the strange coin that the search party found on Sjur's body. \"I'm not sure it was a murder.\"\n\n\n33.\n\nThe search sends her deep into a sublunar cavern where she finds no enemies, but instead clouds of steam and a half-man with grasping tentacles where his face should be.\n\n\"Forgive them,\" he rasps as she crushes his windpipe in her fist.\n\n\"Who?\" she snarls, tightening her grip.\n\nHis face writhes with growing urgency. Reminding herself that she came here for answers first and vengeance second, she pushes him away. He staggers, steadies, reaches into his robes to draw something out—\n\n\"Orin!\" Gol warns, but she's already seen it. She hefts her war hammer and strikes him hard in the chest. It is like hitting a ball off of a tee; there is no resistance. He caroms off of a dewy boulder with a sickening crunch—that is his spine; he will never stand straight again—and as he hits the ground, a tarnished silver jar slips from his fingers. The sound echoes as it bounces away into the dark.\n\n\n34.\n\nOrin uses a hunting knife and brute strength to puncture the jar's dented lid.

When she continues her hunt for the Queen, she feels a crushing fist around her windpipe. There is something she must say, but she has no words to say it. There is somewhere she must go. Someone she must be.\n\nIt is not horrifying, though she thinks it should be. Instead, it is unspeakably lonely.\n\n\n36.\n\nIt grows steadily worse, until it is not possible to tell the difference between day and dream.\n\nShe tries to describe her number-color synesthesia to Gol, to Namqi, to Mara.

He asks whether she's met them, whether they can give a man power, whether they know a way out of this solar system. Orin cannot answer any of his questions but she cannot keep her own stories down. She is sick with them; they come out in a compulsive bilious stream and when she is emptied, she talks of herself. Of her grief. Of her restlessness.

How she feels she is a snake perpetually sloughing away its skin, except this last molt is all wrong and she is caught in the ghost-throat of her old self.\n\nWu Ming leaves his questions by the wayside as he is drawn inexorably into the gravity well of her desperate honesty.

AUDIO UNAVAILABLE.\n\nYour Ghost passed along another couple of transcripts. Broke into the Derelict, did you? You've got good instincts.\n\nSeems to me that the Drifter's picked himself a protégé. Probably another young war hero, like you. If he's writing down his \"lessons,\" maybe he'll write down the one scrap of truth that we need to nail him to the wall. Chase the rest of those \"tapes.\"\n\nIn the meantime, I followed up with my colleagues about the Nine. Used to be that every couple years or so, somebody would get to talking to Xûr, then they'd decide that they were going to be the great mind to crack the mystery of the Nine. Go off to find them. Bunch of Cryptarchs, mostly. A couple Guardians. Then the Light went out during the Red War, and one last ambitious mind went out in search of providence: a Sunbreaker by the name of Orin.\n\nShe came back as the Emissary. Set up the Trials, said the Nine were standing ready to judge the worthiest among us—for what, we don't know. Seems they like strong warriors. The disappearances have stopped since then. I should note here that a couple people called those disappearances \"abductions.\"\n\nWord of advice? Try to keep emotional language out of your reports.\n\nTo the knowledge of the Praxic Order, the Nine aren't allies of the Darkness. We've got solid intel from Reef spies that the Awoken Queen's working with them now beyond the system. Could be that they're up to no good, but—whatever's out there is apparently more important than all that suffering in the Dreaming City, and every Corsair I've talked to believes that through and through. I believe their belief. The Awoken have too much self-respect to live under a bad leader. Bad's different than popular, of course.\n\nAnyway, I don't think the Nine or their Emissary intend to harm you—not right now, at least. It'd be helpful if we knew what they wanted with Drifter, but... That investigation is up to you.

This brings us into consensus with the Vanguard's standing judgment.\n\nThe Shadows of Yor that Gambit conned out of hiding have been thugs with guns and Ghosts, mostly. They have less bite than the Dredgens of yore. Little wonder Shin Malphur didn't show up.

Behind them, an ashen silhouette smoldered on the cliffside.\n\n\"I gave you every chance,\" said the man with the Golden Gun. \"Any last words?\"\n\nOne hostage lifted his head and took a breath. Before he could speak, his skull erupted in a bloom of Arc Light. A Void arrow lanced through the air and lodged in the throat of the second hostage. He slumped over, falling against his dead companion.\n\nThe man turned to look in the direction of the shots. The Golden Gun blazed bright in his fist.\n\nThe Ghosts of the dead Guardians materialized to resurrect their fallen charges—but were cut short as two restraining bands whistled through the trees and snapped across their frames.\n\nThe Ghosts fell, enervated by Arc pulses flowing from their restraints.\n\nLoose pebbles murmured down the cliffside as six Warlocks dressed in black dusters entered the camp single-file. They all carried Quitclaim shotguns.\n\nThe man did not move.\n\nThe woman leading the Warlocks stepped closer to the man. She held out a Cormorant Seal, fearless in the light of his ever-burning Gun. \"Aunor. Praxic Order.\"\n\n\"You're interrupting important work,\" he said.\n\n\"Stole the words right out of my mouth,\" she replied. \"These Ghosts are coming with us. No more killing.

Aunor racked the Quitclaim. Her Warlocks followed her lead.\n\nThe man stood. \"Shaxx wouldn't like it if you all came home in pieces. Take them. I'll be watching. They so much as breathe wrong and they're mine.\"\n\nHe walked into the forest, fist still aflame. The campsite fell to darkness as he disappeared.\n\n\"Secure the Ghosts,\" Aunor ordered her team, holstering her weapon to begin a thorough sweep of the site.","name":"The Salt Mines","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/d2d41d201c1932f5fc45337876be7495.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":4058345182,"index":999,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"4058345177":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The Shadows had her Ghost. They had somehow gotten their hands on restraint tech—Praxic tech.\n\nShe'd have to follow up on that some time. If she lived.\n\nNo Man with a Golden Gun. No fireteam. No backup.\n\nShe had been chasing a lead on a group of new-blood Dredgens, taking her Sparrow over Veridian Bridge to a local Gensym lab. But the Shadows were waiting for her.\n\nFrom a hidden vantage point on an overpass above, a single rocket from a shoulder-mounted launcher had obliterated the road in front of her. She'd been thrown straight off her machine.\n\nIn that split second, she saw Bahaghari had tried to catch her in a beam of Light, but with a telltale whistle and snap, a restraining band had silenced her Ghost. She was falling by then.\n\nShe leaned into the roaring wind, transitioned her fall into a dive. The impact and temperature of the water shocked and chilled her to the bone as debris rained into the lake around her.\n\nShe started the long swim toward shore, toward a road she knew would take her to the overpass.\n\n**\n\nShe pulled up onto the overpass on a hijacked Pike and looked down at the smoldering wreckage of the bridge where she had fallen an hour ago. Bahaghari was nowhere in sight, but her helmet's visor picked up an echo of Void discharge from a sniper's vantage. It was consistent with the launch pattern of a shoulder-mounted Countess SA/2.\n\nShe patched it back to Drifter, and in return, he gave her the coordinates of three possible Shadow safehouses in the area. Without Bahaghari, she had to input them manually to her tracker HUD.\n\nShe selected the farthest one from her position and gunned the Pike.\n\n**\n\nBy the time she pulled up to an abandoned warehouse in District 125, the Shadows had already ransomed her Ghost on several City bands. They wanted clearance to take their jumpships out of the system by midnight. Without clearance, they'd kill Bahaghari.\n\nThe Vanguard ignored the missive entirely. Renegades were not to be negotiated with. Not even Osiris himself. And these Shadows were no Osiris.\n\nThe maglev train coming from Core East roared on a rail above. The next train would arrive at midnight.\n\nShe could see a light on the top floor of the rust-red building, and the silhouettes of several people.\n\n\"I'm not on that floor,\" Bahaghari said. Aunor started.\n\n\"How—\"\n\n\"I hacked the restraint. It's Praxic tech. We've got a renegade in the Order.\"\n\n\"Worry about that later. You said you're not on the top floor?\"\n\n\"No. The basement. Under the street. Building's empty except for us. Don't even think about a breach, you'll need a team. Or a Gjallarhorn.\"\n\n\"Don't have either, Bighari.\"\n\n\"Don't even think about it.\"\n\n\"I didn't say anything.\"\n\n\"You never call me that unless you're about to do something stupid.\"\n\n**\n\nShe had never driven a maglev train before. She liked the feel of power in the front car, watching the world hurtle past.\n\nThe train was empty. She had ordered all the passengers and the conductor off before she'd requisitioned it. You could convince people to do almost anything with a Cormorant Seal.\n\nThe turn came rushing up, and she keyed a control on her wrist.\n\nA series of proximity mines on the rail and the barrier that supported it exploded, and the train hurtled forward through the smoke and fire—\n\nDown onto a rust-red warehouse building far below.\n\n**\n\nShe could see everything Bahaghari could see, even in death.\n\nFor those inside the building, it was like the world was ending.\n\nBut her Ghost was free, heading straight for the front car of the train that had impaled the upper floor of the warehouse. A pair of injured Shadows, the only survivors, were right behind her as she came up to Aunor's slumped body, her eye blazing with Light.\n\nAunor emerged from a radiant column and ducked under the bleeding Shadow's haymaker, slamming a blazing palm into his gut. She burned straight through him and rolled forward on the momentum, under a thundering shot from the second Shadow's hand cannon.\n\nShe transitioned the roll into a stiff sidekick from the ground, shattering the man's unarmored knee. She mounted him as he fell and bludgeoned him unconscious with a rain of burning elbows.\n\nBahaghari came up behind her. \"There are three more bodies... somewhere under this train. What now?\"\n\nAunor stood up, covered in blood and ash.\n\n\"We take their Ghosts. Alert the Vanguard. We have five renegades in custody.\"\n\nAunor found her duster in the train cab, tattered and badly burnt. She put it on, clasped her Cormorant Seal in place, and sat next to the bodies, waiting for her prisoners' Ghosts to materialize.\n\nHer radio clicked.\n\n\"No casualties. You did well,\" Ikora said.\n\n\"Are you speaking as the head of the Warlocks or the head of the Hidden?\" Aunor returned.\n\n\"As your friend. You slipped, but you saved it. Zavala and I appreciate your help in this. It's imperative—\"\n\n\"That Drifter and Gambit continue, yes.\"\n\n\"Aunor.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are we good? We're asking a lot of you.\"\n\n\"I don't ever want your job. And the City needs that rat man's connections and his means. If he can bring Orin back to us...\"\n\n\"Mm.

And in doing so, they will turn us against ourselves—feeding our lust, our greed, our fear, until we become a threat unto ourselves like none we could imagine. So, wield these, angry reaper. Strive to know the darkness in your own heart. Walk in the shadows of fallen heroes. And know that you are an enemy of hope.\"\n\n—a warning","name":"Thorn","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"To rend one's enemies is to see them not as equals, but objects—hollow of spirit and meaning.\" —13th Understanding, 7th Book of Sorrow","hash":1412052556,"index":1012,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"434328305":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"I want out, man.

They welcome him into their lean little camp. They feed him: clean water, unseasoned rabbit, a tiny dipper of honey. They entertain him: rumors, jokes, an epic that takes more than an hour and a half to tell. These are the first Risen he has ever met, and he quickly decides he wants to be just like them.\n\nThere is one woman among them that stands out. Her skin is like his.

A log in the fire snaps.\n\n\"You think I can stay with you all?\" he asks eventually, full of cautious optimism.\n\nThe woman looks at his tattered cloak, his knives, his lean build.

Yor fertilized the wilds with suffering and despair that a new hope would grow. I was that hope. My fire showed that whispers could be hushed. To many the legend, and the lesson, ends there. They're wrong. Dangerously so. Yor's true lesson—and by extension Rezyl's—wasn't that strength beats strength. His lesson was far more subtle, and infinitely more grand. Adversity leads to evolution.

The Guardians who joined in the Drifter's games have proven to be the perfect guinea pigs to demonstrate a larger point—the shadows of dark power that tempt us are not inherently evil. In fact, they are simply another tool to be used if we hope to bend the unknown to our will, an impossible feat we must learn to master if we wish to push back the ever-aggressive tide of extinction.\n\nAzzir knew this. Long ago. Long before anyone else, he saw the path forward; he simply didn't understand it. His courage and strength clouded the dangers of the path he tread. The path we now walk. The difference being we have Azzir's folly to guide us. We can, and have, learned from his mistakes. That some level of deceit was needed to further my goal of seeing Azzir's path to the end is... unfortunate. But necessary.\n\nThe stage set by the foul sport the Drifter has crafted has given many Guardians the confidence they need to see the shadows for what they are without losing their way or tainting their Light. This was Azzir's gravest mistake. He plunged freely into the abyss thinking his will alone could fend off the whispers and the corruption. But alone we all fall. Only together can we thrive in light... and dark.\n\nWhich leads to the other need addressed by Gambit's promise. Those Guardians who would give freely of themselves and seek not only power in the shadows, but comfort. Purpose. They have been drawn out and addressed. Some with force and, sadly, an end.

Even his interest in the archives and the observatory has vanished—he no longer cares to study a universe that has offended him. He doubts his own divinity, because how could a god allow this to happen? His rage has gone and he does not know what he has left after it. The new shape I feel in his mind is gray and smooth like fog.\n\nAmong my people—I mean my people, the people of the chalice, not the whole Psion species—we call this feeling \"sweet oubliette,\" the shelter that becomes a prison. For Calus, I imagine it feels like the loss of all appetite. Even the curiosity that made him great.\n\nThe councilors ask me to go to him. But I am still afraid. What if he sees my secret?

My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe are at war. Here at the fringe of the empire, fleets clash over emptiness. In council, we surmise that the tyrant Ghaul wants this void as a buffer against invasion—but isn't the irony bitter? This enemy desires nothing but our death. And so we oblige them by dying for nothing.\n\nIt is the opposite of everything Calus wanted for his people. Even the new Cabal's ships are expendable. These are not the beautiful deterrents of Calus's armada; they are ugly, hasty, and crude. The crews live in their armor, prisoners of their duty, escaping only through music and games smuggled into the battlenet. One popular pastime, I understand, is to draft personal \"fleets\" and \"legions\" from among real Cabal ships and soldiers, competing with comrades to win the most victories. Of course it is very bad luck to draft your own unit.\n\nThe enemy is yet worse. All Psions live in a world of minds. I believe in the cup and all its spirits because I feel those spirits every day—the prints left by other minds on the things I touch and see. These Hive... have no spirit. Their souls are emaciated. Some horrible solvent has stripped them of everything but hate, cunning, and the will to survive. I think they worship death because it is the only salvation from their existence.\n\nI suggested that the War Councilors invite Calus to observe one of Ghaul's carrier groups attacking a Hive war moon. He came because he knows the value of pretending to care. But even the shape of the fleet hurt him; Ghaul and his tyrannical ally Umun'arath have abandoned proud, independent cruisers (instruments of state, Calus liked to say) for swarms of frigates that suckle fuel from enormous fleet carriers. The Hive's portals leave no time or space for elegant vector dances, so these new ships are built for brutal exchanges at point-blank range.\n\nWe felt other Psions at work, hiding the traitor fleet from the Hive as they scattered drills and boarding pods in the war moon's path. A strike at the surface was not enough; someone would have to bring a planet-cracker warhead down into the moon's viscera. Caught up in the excitement, I asked one of the war councilors how we could possibly prevail against the Hive, who were so old and so powerful.\n\nShe compared our Cabal to a seagoing warship and the Hive to a submarine. They might dive into deep metaphysical layers of existence, where we are no match for them. But in the ordinary universe, the Hive are like a submarine on the surface: still dangerous, but not invincibly so.\n\nI was fascinated and secretly struck by the clarity of the goblet on her face. Did she believe we could ultimately defeat the Hive?\n\nNo, she said. But we could hold them back long enough to live our lives. Wasn't that enough?\n\nInviting Calus was a mistake. It only reminded him that he had no power at all.","name":"Entry II","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1489617035,"index":1094,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1489617034":{"displayProperties":{"description":"By the mind of Match.

My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nI was in the observatory today when he came to me. I should have been vetting a list of loyalists for the countercoup, but in truth, I was watching the ruined mirrors of an ancient starshell as they plummeted four hundred million kilometers into a blue sun. They look like crumpled handkerchiefs. Their fall is very slow, and those who made them are eons dead.\n\nHere on our Leviathan, all is reborn. The guard companies have buffed their armor to a syrupy shine. The ship responds ably to our commands, and we can barely quench its appetite for mass to feed its engines and factories. Music fills the gardens, the gardeners hum along as they trim and weed, and Calus dallies in the kitchens with a pinch of spice, once more unmistakably himself.\n\nI haven't thought into this journal since that day at the edge, when Calus came out of his observation bubble overflowing with joy. \"It's the end,\" he bellowed, giddy as a girl with her first tusks. \"It's magnificent, it's divine, it's more than I ever was! Match, it's the end of everything!\"\n\nHe frightened me. That day frightened all of us—none of us will speak of it, and we do not dare more than the shallowest metaconcert, lest our memories pool into a deadly truth. But in that void, Calus saw his purpose renewed. He guided us to reset the failed navigation system, repair the traitors' sabotage, and retake control. I thought we would hurry back to the homeworld, but Calus no longer seems to pine for his lost throne... or to care at all about the reforms he once championed.\n\nNow we wander the galaxy on an epicurean crusade, sampling a bounty of raw furies and rare delights. All the inquisitiveness and avarice that Calus once poured into government he now extends to his appetites. I have seen Calus feast on things no living mouth can eat. A chill superfluid of helium-4, whorled in his cup for ten years by a single turn of his wrist: he returned a decade later to toss it back. Or a pea of neutronium that should have torn through him like fog. He told me it tasted like the thickest fudge.\n\nHe is changing.\n\nHe was here a moment ago. The ruined starshell caught his attention: He loves beauty, and millions of mirror-bright sails folding up like tissues in wind to fall into a blue giant are very beautiful. Eons ago, someone built these mirrors to hover on the blue star's light, and for a while, I suppose, they lived in sun-fed paradise.\n\n\"How did they die?\" I asked.\n\n\"That, Match, is the wrong question.\" He tuned the observation room to track a single tumbling mirror. In life, the sail had been as wide as the space between a world and its moon; in death, the rigging had collapsed into a thistle of spinmetal and glint. \"What you should ask is why I am so glad they died!\"\n\nI could not imagine, and I admitted it. \"These beings were much like us. They did not travel through time or lacerate the universe and crawl into the wounds or yearn for the patronage of any old machine... they were creatures of material ambition, of physics, of life. If they failed, it is an omen of death for us.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Calus said, with wry generosity. \"They were grand once. They thought, very briefly, that they would live forever. And they were wrong. We would be very ungrateful to refuse the lesson, wouldn't we?\"\n\nI sat before a fountain and tried to pour out the spirits for guidance, but they would not explain.\n\n(An addendum, later: I have not seen Calus in the flesh since.)","name":"Entry V","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1489617036,"index":1097,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1489617039":{"displayProperties":{"description":"By the mind of Match, Shadow Councilor to the True Emperor. Upon the Leviathan, triumphant in our Emperor's battle. Today I fill the Y-goblet with linen, so that my ancestors may tie up their wounds. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe have conquered the Clipse.\n\nAmong all the clients of Calus's reign, all those diverse species he encouraged to join and influence our great culture, the Clipse were one of his dearest favorites. When they greeted his return with missiles, it wounded him terribly. But Calus neither sulked nor raged nor signaled them in the dead of their night to woefully demand an explanation. This I credit to his mysterious new philosophy.\n\nInstead, he asked Valus Nohr to plan and execute the reconquest of the Clipse, using only the Leviathan and the troops aboard. Then he asked me to deliver an account of Clipse history since the coup.\n\nCalus was proud of his aid to the Clipse. They are—were—trapped in endless war with their alien-infested biosphere, which spawns horrors wherever it grows. Calus saw this war as a regrettable but unalterable fact, so instead of military support, he sought to enrich the Clipse with fine culture and high luxury. The Clipse were not pleased. After Ghaul's mutiny, the Dominus tried to secure their loyalty by sending a fleet group to \"win\" their ancient war.\n\nOf course, the legionaries discovered it was impossible to conquer the xenocidal ecosystem without destroying the planet itself. Their efforts only poisoned the Clipse, both world and people. After a century of botched climate engineering, toxic shock attacks, and \"clear and hold\" nonsense, Ghaul wrote off the tormented Clipse as \"no longer essential to the strategic security of the empire.\"\n\nI think the Clipse hoped they could win back Ghaul's favor by defying Calus. Perhaps they thought their world was unconquerable. Perhaps they were even right, in the end. Valus Nohr landed on their moon and military capital Kaga-Clipse with just six thousand troops. For eight weeks, the Clipse attacked her by ground and by orbit as their robotic interceptors swarmed the Leviathan. I was not part of the great metaconcert that helped protect us, but the might of gathered minds filled the carpets with static and gave me constant déjà vu.\n\nWhen Nohr broke out of her bastion on her famous thunder run, calling down the Leviathan's missiles on the vital command posts she'd identified, the Clipse defense crumbled. Their last desperate act was a commando strike at the Leviathan itself. The boarding craft slipped under our sensors, but the metaconcert felt the vengeful purpose aboard.\n\nCalus stopped us from firing. \"I welcome their attempt,\" he said. \"Let me see their spirit.\"\n\nI called to ask his intentions—I have not seen him face to face for longer than I can count. \"I'm curating my followers, Match,\" he answered. \"Thinking about the shadows I'll cast.\"\n\nThe Clipse attack failed, of course, but there was a survivor—the one named Rull. Some think he earned a face-to-face meeting with Calus, though I doubt it was truly His Face. With Kaga-Clipse in our control, we could destroy the Clipse world at our leisure. Calus rewarded their surrender by giving Rull a gift: everything the Clipse needed to end their agonizing perpetual war.\n\nIt was a sheet of paper, the thick rough-edged sort that Calus makes out of cometary water and cotton from his personal garden (he says that he likes the smell). Rull signed it after two hours in a room with Calus. The Leviathan's factories shuddered into motion, forging luxurious self-contained arcologies, pocket worlds that could hold thousands in perpetual comfort.\n\nWhen Rull's chosen people were safe in the arcologies, the guns of Kaga-Clipse bombarded the Clipse homeworld into a global firestorm. The chosen survivors in the arcologies would inherit lives of plenty. The rest had the peace of ash. The eternal war was over.\n\nI prayed to the cup in the mirror for answers. But it was Calus who responded.\n\n\"Match.\" He spoke into my mind just as a Psion would. \"I told Rull the truth. Everything is going to end soon. We must accept that. What matters is the joy and companionship we can find before the final moment. Why let billions suffer for a future that will never come? Life with no dignity and no purpose except to go on living isn't life. It's a virus. It's a curse. Better to die than to become like the Hive.\"\n\nRull left his world to journey with us. I wonder if he could not face what he'd done.","name":"Entry VI","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1489617039,"index":1098,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1489617038":{"displayProperties":{"description":"By the mind of Match, Shadow Councilor to the True Emperor.

A star, I found myself thinking, is an explosion that cannot escape the appetite of its own gravity. \"Poor fortune in supernova scattering left this area short of metals, and now there is nothing left but dim stars, dead worlds, and hydrogen.\"\n\n\"A place of poverty,\" he suggested. \"A graveyard.\"\n\n\"You speak often of death, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"The knowledge of death is the key to happiness.\" He patted the bench beside him, as if acknowledging a missing friend. \"Look out there. Imagine all the trillions of beings who lived among these stars. Do you think some of them were happy?\"\n\n\"I should hope so.\"\n\n\"Why, Match? Why would some be happy, and others miserable?\"\n\n\"Perhaps they had more metal,\" I suggested, dryly.\n\n\"Exactly!\" He clapped in delight, nearly bowling me over. \"Happiness is comparative, Match. I tell you that if a rich man lived next to a woman who had ten times his wealth, he would never be satisfied, even in marriage. He would feel poor when he looked at her. Even the basic satisfactions of our biology require contrast—the absence of thirst, the absence of hunger, the absence of loneliness.\"\n\n\"This is a child's philosophy, your Majesty,\" I protested. \"We need pain to know pleasure? We need loss to make us treasure gain? A runt would say these things. Why, you once told me that these are homilies the miserable use to excuse their misery. Suffering does not heighten happiness. Fear does not bless us. True contentment is true in itself.\"\n\nHe looked at me with great satisfaction, delighted by my insight, and by the way my words reflected his own wisdom. \"What was the flaw in my empire, Match? Why did Ghaul overthrow me?\"\n\nI sensed he did not want my first answer: because those disenfranchised and infuriated by his cosmopolitan reforms had united without his knowledge. \"Because you did not fear death, your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Exactly! I opened my arms to embrace all my peoples, offering them consumption without limit and celebration without end. The stars themselves burned sweet and clear, and I forgot—even stars die.\" He leaned closer to me. I felt warmth like an oven under his counterfeit skin. \"You're right. The truly happy do not need misery and suffering to give their lives meaning. They exist in the moment, at peace with their inevitable death. Now that I've accepted all this will end... it has meaning again, Match! I have MORE than the rest of the universe. I've seen what's coming! I know the value of every moment left!\"\n\nHe smiled at me, his cleft pulled back from bright teeth. \"And I want you to value those moments too, Match. I wonder... if there is something you want to tell me. Something that would change the rest of your life. Make no mistake: an end is coming, soon, and you will have no chance at all afterwards to correct what you regret. So why delay? Why not tell me?\"\n\nI do not remember the excuse I made as I fled.","name":"Entry VII","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1489617038,"index":1099,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1489617025":{"displayProperties":{"description":"By the mind of Match, priest of the chalice.

How could I be a god if I was... generic?\n\n\"But now that I have seen what is coming, now that there is a limit to the time afforded to us... well, it may sound cruel, Match, but the less there is of everything else, the more I matter. I intend to be the last good thing in this world. I will gather my chosen companions and ease as much suffering as I can before the end. There are emperors who would take on any shape to escape death. I am not one. I am true to myself. And so, Match, are you.\"\n\nHe clapped me on the back with enormous gentleness. \"Your only crime, my councilor, was that you denied me the chance to give you a gift. Come.

The Emperor rightly agreed and approved the excursion.\n\nWhat follows is an account of the reclamation of the Athenaeum World X:\n\nThe Shadows of Earth, of the Eliksni, and of the Awoken arrived on the ice planet that held Emperor Calus's Athenaeum World X, the name of which has been lost to time. This planet, being a repository for precious, ancient knowledge collected by the Emperor, was chosen for its hostile environment, which served as a built-in defense system for intruders and thieves.\n\nEn route to the planet's Inner Sanctum, where the athenaeum world's knowledge was kept, the Shadows were stalked by an undocumented species of indigenous wildlife, whose natural capabilities as a predator proved unexpectedly debilitating to the companion-soul of the Shadow of Earth. The Shadow, being symbiotically reliant on its companion-soul, was thus weakened and the trio was forced to bivouac in place beneath a great monolith as a storm fell upon them.\n\nThe creatures, who so far had lurked at the edges of the party's vision, crept closer under cover of the storm, which grew ever stronger, and executed a stealth attack. Thus began a bloody battle, wherein the three Shadows fought back half a dozen creatures with modest success, and wherein the Shadow of the Eliksni fell in combat.

These messages read: \"Remove your forces from our planets and moons, or we will respond with deadly force.\"\n\nBut Emperor Calus had seen Death at the edge of the universe and was not afraid, for these figureheads and their War Machine were not Death.\n\nThe Emperor Calus, in his wisdom and mercy, permitted his Shadow of Earth to sit down to negotiations with the Earth Vanguard. Although the Shadow of Earth spoke of the Emperor and his knowledge of the coming end, the Earth Vanguard were so attached to their worldly struggles that they could not hear.

After the reclamation of the Athenaeum World X, which held in it the secrets of one of the most advanced predators in the system, the Aphelion, which had the power to devastate whole worlds in the blink of an eye, the Shadow was able to use this lost knowledge to rebuild the Loyalist fleet stronger and more magnificent than ever.\n\nWith the renewed ships of the Loyalist Fleet, the Shadow of Earth led an attack on the War Machine's seat of power, the region of Hellas Basin on the planet Mars.

Not all in the Order thought it the right path. Despite the good we could do in the wilds, there was disagreement, judgement.

The fall was necessary for creation to escape its first imperfect stasis and seek a truer form. Heresy? Well, then, I am the heresiarch. The philosopher died of a bowel disease. Those who do not exist cannot suffer and are of no account to any viable ethics. If the true path to goodness is the elimination of suffering, then only those who must exist can be allowed to exist. It is the nature of life to favor existence over nonexistence, and to prefer the fertile soil to the poisoned wind. Because those who open their mouths to that wind pass from the world and leave no descendant, whether of flesh or of thought.\n\nBut imagine the abomination of a world where nothing can end and no choice can be preferred to any other. Imagine the things that would suffer and never die. Imagine the lies that would flourish without context or corrective.

In it, you may construct a universal computer with the power to simulate, very slowly, any other computer imaginable and thus simulate whole realities, including nested copies of the flower game itself. And the game is undecidable. No one can predict exactly how the game will play out except by playing it.\n\nAnd yet this game is nothing compared to the game played by the gardener and the winnower. It resembles that game as a seed does a flower—no, as a seed resembles the star that fed the flower and all the life that made it.\n\nIn their game, the gardener and the winnower discovered shapes of possibility.

The protein weighs only as much as 47,000 protons, not 53,000. If you were a cell, you would think p53 was a mistake too. It has several coercive functions: To delay the cell's growth. To sterilize the cell when it is old. And to force the cell into self-destruction if it becomes too independent.\n\nWould you tolerate a bomb in your body, waiting to detonate if you deviated from the needs of society?\n\nHowever, without p53 as an enforcer, the body's utopian surplus of energy becomes a paradise for cancer. Cells cannot resist the temptation to steal from that surplus. Their genetic morality degrades as tumor suppressor genes fail. The only way to stop them is by punishment.\n\nYou now confront the basic problem of morality. It is the alignment of individual incentives with the global needs of the structure.\n\nPatterns will participate in a structure only if participation benefits their ability to go on existing. The more successful the structure grows, the more temptation accrues to cheat. And the greater the advantage the cheaters gain over their honest neighbors. And the greater the ability they develop to capture the very laws that should prevent their selfishness.

There's no way to know which are real.\n\nFrom a certain point of view, they might all be.\n\nSome things he recognizes. He sees the Traveler often, though he can't feel its Light through the bars of his cage. Sometimes it hangs over a city so familiar it makes his heart ache. Sometimes it hangs in an alien sky, and foreign shapes make airy loops around it—Ghosts of unrecognizable make.\n\nSome visions he gets once, while some come back over and over again. One recurring image: a piece of the Traveler cracked off from its body, lying belly-up in a forest, with a small figure standing in front of it. The figure changes every time, but the sickly glow of the Traveler doesn't.\n\nOnce, he sees a vision of himself. Straight-shouldered, warm in the Martian sun, standing between Kabr and Pahanin. Kabr's helmet is familiar; it's one Praedyth helped make. He was a defter hand with spinfoil lamination than Kabr ever was. Kabr had worn that helmet barely five years into their life as a fireteam, worn it for six straight months, till he cracked it in half in the Crucible. That vision makes Praedyth weep—desiccated as he is, he didn't think he had it in him.\n\nThe Vault shows him Mercury again and again, recognizable only thanks to the scale of the sun in the sky. Sometimes there's rubble hanging in space, a planetary ring still forming. Sometimes there's nothing but rubble, and when he turns, he doesn't see any of the other planets in the system. Gone, somehow, eaten down to the crumbs.\n\nPraedyth wouldn't mind those visions so much if he could only feel the warmth of that colossal sun. His hands are always cold, here in the Vault.\n\nHe sees waves of aliens cross the solar system's threshold, emerging into the light from outside the heliopause. Some of them travel with the air of eager, conquering armies, paint fresh and banners snapping. Some of them move as if they're on the run from something behind them, out in the galactic dark.\n\nHe watches the movements of the Vex. He learns to tell them apart: the shining silver ones, the brass ones with backswept horns, the ones with eyes glowing white. Occasionally, scattered among them are pockets of Vex stained with verdigris, their arms trailing shawls of moss. All the other Vex keep away from those ones. Twice, he's seen other Vex fight the mossy ones. It looks like the other Vex are frightened of them, as much as Vex can be.\n\nSome timelines have veils drawn over them, a darkness too thick to see through. They push back against Praedyth's sight, resisting.\n\nAll the timelines he sees could be true for some living thing. He doesn't know which are true for him. He doesn't know if that's a meaningful question to ask.\n\nHe asks it anyway, and he keeps looking.

Some have grown far different from their progenitors.\n\nSome have not.\n\n\"We have to base the modifications on the ansible system,\" one Duane-McNiadh says. He's either from 227.13 or 227.204. The voices have been bickering in his ear for what feels like hours.\n\n\"The ansible is a thought experiment! It was proved impossible!\" says another.

Praedyth jumps in. \"What materials would we need, hypothetically? We're limited by what I've got with me.\"\n\nHe's in contact with six groups of them, all based in Vex network systems near Venus. They must be within ambit of the Vault's entrance, whatever that means. There are more of them further out both in the solar system and in the Vex information networks: up to two hundred and twenty-one more, apparently. There must be a way to contact them too, to use whatever let them connect with him and go even further, till they can figure out why now and what's happening. What the Vex are doing.\n\n\"What do you have with you?\" That's Maya, Dr. Sundaresh. Brisk. The others listen to her when she speaks.\n\nHe has three guns, two disassembled down to their casings for parts. Two boxes of physical ammo and one of Omolon energy cells he's been using to power his radio. He stripped his armor down long ago; he made a comm unit from his helmet and pulled fine coils of wire from the conductive pads on his gauntlets and steel plating from his boots. In his pockets, he's got lint and the wrapper from a candy Pahanin tossed at his head half an hour before they entered the Vault. It's worn soft and folded into the shape of a crane. No Ghost. Her loss is one thing he has never gotten used to after all this time in the Vault; he still wakes up some days expecting the small weight of her on his shoulder.\n\n\"Anything to etch circuitry with?\"\n\n\"If you give me ten minutes.\" He's got a laser pointer and the focusing crystal out of his Omolon rifle.\n\nWhile he works, all of the Chiomas hold their own discussion.\n\n\"If Praedyth exists physically, even if the space he's in isn't strictly real, he has accesses we don't.

It has gone through. He whoops raggedly; a dozen Ishtar Collective scientists return the cheer.\n\nThey start to send messages scattershot, wherever they can, whenever the pulses climb high enough to boost their signal.

No light emerges from them.\n\nDuane-McNiadh walks too quickly, not testing the ground. He's gone before you can blink—fallen through an unseen edge of the simulation. When you move to where he disappeared, tilting your head at a certain angle makes the world give itself over to empty black with glowing wireframe edges that don't do anything to illuminate it. Tilt your head back, and there's nothing but purple wheat and the far-off call of an unknown bird.\n\n\"We have to go after him,\" says Maya, \"we can't just leave him—\"\n\nYou're all still shocked, faces drawn. Shim bends for a rock, squints, and tosses the stone underhand at the edge of the simulation. It disappears before it can hit the peak of its arc. He shakes his head.\n\nYou and Maya repeat the experiment, heads cocked like nervy sparrows.

I hate it. But I like the idea that people can believe in a good person. If they believe in one, they can believe in more.\" His laugh reaches more than his eyes this time, soft and confident. You would never know he was thinking, constantly and acutely, about your idea of Right, and how he could satisfy it. \"May I ask you for a favor?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I want to be with you when you meet the soldiers.\"\n\nShe looks at him in surprise. \"YOU want to liaise with the military? No offense, David, but you seem like a rough fit.\"\n\n\"I knew her.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The woman on the radio. Crown Six.\" Two centuries of practice tell Mia there's heartbreak behind that calm voice. \"Before she was uploaded.\"\n\n\"Uploaded?\"\n\n\"She's an Exo now. A troubleshooter for SOLSECCENT.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Mia says. \"That'll be a weird reunion.\"\n\nThe dropships come down so fast Mia is sure they will crash, plunge into the methane sea, and sink like uranium bricks. She watches by cortical video as they make their blindingly bright suicide burns, flesh-peeling, 30-g decelerations into an arrogantly precise hover five meters above the arcology dome. Dark metal figures leap from the dropships, naked in Titan's flash-freeze cold and untroubled by 1.6 atmospheres of pressure. A drizzle of gasoline rain slicks their alloy skin. They move with inhuman efficiency.\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" Mia shakes her head at the absurdity of the universe. \"Like we need transhuman infantry to evacuate a city!\"\n\nShe heads for the door and the elevator, but Xiana McCaig, Ismail Barat, and Maury Yamashita are blocking the way. \"I know,\" Mia says, holding up her hands. \"You refuse to leave. You're staying here with me. You want to save everything you can.\"\n\nXiana, who secretly wanted to impress her, is crestfallen. Dear Maury's diver instincts (never leave your buddy, never hold your breath) puff him up with pride: she trusts him! Ismail makes a small, satisfied sound, as if his prediction just came true. Probably he just won a bet with Xiana.\n\n\"Come on.\" Mia hugs her wayward children. \"Come here, you awful kids. I knew you wouldn't leave, because I'm not going to leave either. I want you all to go to Crisis Command and get your staff set up. Ismail, let's assume we're going to lose the satellites; get all the weather forecasts you can, Titan surface and circum-Saturn space. Maury, try to figure out what exactly is about to hit us. Xiana, check on the Duiker, then help Ismail switch everything you can to local management.\"\n\nOn the way to the dorsal air lock, Mia flicks through camera feeds, statistics, and telemetry, watching over the evacuation effort. Not so long ago, a few million frightened people would've been an administrator's worst nightmare. Not these days. Titan's citizens have grown up with game theory and applied community ethics; it's as unthinkable to beg for a priority evacuation as it would be to ask for an old man's seat on the tram. The families of rig workers and shipping tycoons wait side by side for their tickets to be called, for their bodies to be processed into coldsleep SMILE pods and loaded by the thousands, all equally silent, equally delicate, equally helpless.\n\nMia gets a chill. She doesn't know why she's so certain that it's over now, this calm enlightened goodness, this collective decency. But she is.\n\n\"You're scared?\" David asks quietly.\n\n\"Not scared for myself. For… everything. For what we've built.\"\n\n\"We built it well,\" David assures her. \"This is when we'll be our best.\"","name":"The Tenth Avatar","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/46ed85af1a48df4f50390323d944b376.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1090101138,"index":1176,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1090101139":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Mia van der Venne is more than 200 years old. Change comes faster, these days, and you live to see more of it. Changes like Ismail being allowed to pray not in the real direction of Mecca but in the direction Mecca would be if it were transposed from Earth to Titan. Changes like the rise and fall and rise again of the Bray cult of personality. Like the new worlds the Traveler opens up to humanity.\n\nAnd changes like the woman who calls herself Crown Six.\n\nShe has the compact, endomorphic build of someone's mom, a shape that would be disarmingly ordinary if it were not rearmed by glowing eyes, empty sunken cheeks, a thickly armored jaw, and a bare scalp studded with needled sensors. The petrol stink of Titan's atmosphere washes off her, mingled with the clean astringent bite of air lock spray. Like all Exos, she was once a person—someone who gave up her flesh for the tenuous immortality of a war body. Mia, unfairly, thinks she looks like an angry mannequin.\n\n\"Welcome to New Pacific Arcology,\" Mia says. Far beneath them, the lights of residential stacks dim and flicker out as people report to their podding stations. Information kiosks flare up in distant blue, flashing directions to the lost. A vacuum robot scurries along the catwalk behind them.\n\n\"Administrator van der Venne,\" the woman says, with careful consideration, \"thank you for your welcome.\" She turns back to collect some item of equipment. An etiquette flash blinks in the air beside her, totally unpersonalized: it is just the standard warning against substrate chauvinism.\n\n\"Hi, Morgan,\" David Korosec says, with a softness Mia has never heard before, a softness not meant for her ears. \"Are you happier?\"\n\nIt is as if he has waited a long, long time to ask that.\n\nCrown Six looks up in very human surprise. \"David,\" she says, guardedly. \"Tell me you're not still—\"\n\n\"An ethicist? Sorry, Morgan. Still me.\"\n\n\"Then I'm not speaking to you,\" the Exo says and turns to Mia. \"Administrator van der Venne, I'm here under SOLSECCENT's special security protocol for extreme crisis. I must ask for your compliance and all possible assistance with our mission.\"\n\nAn eight-legged crate walks out of the air lock behind her, shepherded by two more silent Exos. The beast of burden proffers body armor and firearms: not just bliss rifles or restraint spiders, but actual, lethal, bullet-shooting guns.\n\n\"No,\" Mia says, with more heat than she intends, but not more than she feels. \"I won't allow you inside with deadly weapons. This is a legally autonomous settlement, chartered under—\"\n\nMorgan points a bladed hand at her. The symbolic suggestion of violence alone is shocking enough to cut Mia's sentence short. \"Administrator van der Venne, there is a CARRHAE WHITE emergency in effect. As an AI-COM operative, I have the right to use force where and how I see fit. So, if you don't get me where I need to go and help me remove any obstacles to my goal, I will realign you with my mission parameters.\" She cocks her head. It's so human. \"Am I clear?\"\n\n\"Are you threatening to shoot me?\" Mia stares at the Exo woman in disbelief. She hasn't seen a gun in nearly 50 years, and now they are not only coming into her habitat, but they're also pointed at her.\n\n\"I won't shoot you.\" The needles of Morgan's scalp glitter. \"But I will tell you that I could, if I found it necessary.\"\n\n\"This is wrong!\" David barks. \"I know you, Morgan. You believe in sacrosanct human will, and the primacy of informed individual agency, and the need for powerful actors to obtain consent. The person I knew would never—\"\n\n\"The person you knew might have had time for this conversation,\" Morgan says, with vicious remove. The pronoun dance suggests shared personal history that Mia has no business asking after or caring about. \"I don't. Administrator, my team will now proceed to Shanice Pell's lab to secure our objective. If you're with me, maybe it gets done faster. If not, maybe it gets done messier. Your choice.\"\n\nOf course. Of course it's about Shanice Pell. Who else?\n\nA silent alarm throbs in Mia's sensorium, like a snake coiling around her wrist. Down in the residential blocks, one of her citizens has lifted one too many boxes and manifested presymptoms of a heart attack. EMTs are on the way, so it probably won't be the day's first death. Probably. Life burns so easily. It's her job to stand up to those who forget that.\n\n\"I'll escort you to the lab,\" she says. \"May I assume that you're interested in containing some data at the Pell lab? Should I close our airspace? We are in the middle of—\"\n\n\"You'll do nothing,\" Morgan says, confidently but incorrectly. \"I'm killing all your satellite uplinks except for text and basic flight telemetry.\"\n\n\"Who ordered this?\" Mia demands. \"On what grounds can SOLSEC impose some high-handed protocol on my Arcology?\"\n\nMorgan does not make the obvious correction: not who ordered this, but what.","name":"Faces Like Shields","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/46ed85af1a48df4f50390323d944b376.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1090101139,"index":1177,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1090101140":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The beam kisses the rising shuttle and cuts through it, like a wire through a block of butter, as if the ship and everyone inside were as thin as the hydrocarbon sleet. Thunder booms, louder than Earth's, through heavy nitromethane air.\n\nMia watches the debris strike the smooth black ocean and sink. She can't breathe. There is something like a whittled mulberry branch stuck in her throat.\n\n\"Do you realize this is your fault?\" Morgan-2 groans, inviting no dispute about whether it is in fact Mia van der Venne's fault (yes, in a complicated way) but, rather, asking her if she accepts it.\n\nDo you see, Mia? Do you see how you killed them?\n\nIt was a good plan, she'd thought. Smuggling Shanice Pell out on the evacuation ships was the right thing to do. Because it put Shanice Pell's personal autonomy above the needs of any enigmatic emergency protocol. Because it gave Shanice a choice about what to do with her data, instead of yielding that choice to Morgan and her Exos.\n\n\"Why?\" David Korosec whispers. \"Morgan, you murdered all those people… why?!\"\n\nIt should've worked. Mia never betrayed herself to the Exos' electronic warfare with a telltale signal. She didn't warn Pell with a crude mechanical sign, like a blinking light or a gushing faucet, that a watching AI might detect. She hid her alarm in the social chaos of the Arcology's evacuation: simply by failing to renew a hold order, she allowed one of her security frames to detain a Clovis Bray executive in Dome 2. The Clovis corporate embassy sent a team to unsnarl the situation, and that unexpected Clovis sortie triggered Shanice Pell's sentinel programs and kicked off her red-alert evacuation protocol. She was already evacuating, just like everyone else, but now she believed (correctly) that someone was after her.\n\nShanice and her lab ran before Morgan's Exos could reach them. Ran with the data Morgan came to silence.\n\nThe probe. This must be about the Pell deep-space probe. That \"demonstration of self-sufficiency\" that caused such vicious, quiet controversy. What did it find?\n\nWhen Morgan-2's network senses warned her of Pell's flight, Mia thought she'd won. Saved the radically self-sufficient scientist from the big bad Warmind and its paranoid goons.\n\nBut Morgan-2 had just covered her glowing eyes. \"Administrator. Didn't you understand that I was the humane option? Didn't you think?\"\n\nAnd down from the sky, swift and stealthy as the Warsat that fired it, came the invisible discharge of an X-ray laser to light the shuttle's propellant like a lantern. The beam path was hot-white, straight as poured silver, collapsing instantly: a crash of pure-tone thunder as the tunnel of burnt air closes in on itself. And the shuttle opening like a ghastly blossom, the shape of a thing going upward very quickly, no longer in one piece.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Mia had gasped, not understanding at first: Was it an accident? Had the phantom disaster finally arrived on Titan and struck its first blow? This was the age of life, and governments did not, ever, use force against human beings. There were always alternatives. Every soul sacred. Every evil treatable.\n\nThen she understood what the Warmind had done.","name":"Kalki's Burning Sword, Part I","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/46ed85af1a48df4f50390323d944b376.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1090101140,"index":1178,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1090101141":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Now she kneels trembling on the carpet outside Pell's abandoned lab as Morgan-2 shouts in grief and rage. \"I didn't want this.

I told you we were prepared to kill.\"\n\nBut this! An entire shuttle—all those people… Those poor, poor people…\n\n\"I know what this means,\" David Korosec pronounces. He's gotten down to his knees beside Mia, but he won't reach out, won't touch her without consent. \"A Warmind fired that weapon. Warminds don't take human life… unless they're in the TWILIGHT EXIGENT moral territory.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Mia demands, wanting, needing, some kind of sense.\n\n\"It means,\" Morgan-2 says, mercilessly, \"that all human beings are assumed dead without protective action. The Warminds are now acting to maximize survival, not to minimize harm. Death is cheap, the garden's on fire, and it's a race to save whatever we can.\"\n\nThat's not sense. Mia can't make sense of that at all.\n\n\"What if they're wrong?\" David gets to his feet. \"Morgan, they just murdered a ship full of innocent people to contain this data. Is the secret worth it? What if they're wrong?!\"\n\n\"They can't be wrong. They're too smart.\"\n\n\"Oh, no you don't, you haven't forgotten that much!\" He comes at Morgan, fearless in his authority for all his physical powerlessness. \"You know intelligence is semiorthogonal to morality!

You know I can be sure. Morgan, please.

Mia conjures up telemetry from Titan's satellite halo. What's accelerating?\n\nShe calls for radar data, a map of Titan's surface. And then she sees it.\n\nHer moon is squashing.\n\nTitan is deforming from a spheroid into an egg. Something out there is pulling on Titan—a hand with a force greater than Saturn's entire mass. And the moon is answering the only way it can, by bulging outward: already fifteen meters, still growing.\n\nThe pull will cause strain, tremors, tides. And when that pull lets go, there will be a wave to make Ziusudra and Atrahasis and Noah and Manu and Deucalion cower in fear. Bergelmir might have navigated a deluge of blood, but not even he had to sail on liquid methane.\n\nNor reckon with the apocalyptic tidal forces of a second ocean, fourteen times as vast as Earth's oceans combined, buried 50 kilometers below the surface.","name":"Kalki's Burning Sword, Part II","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/46ed85af1a48df4f50390323d944b376.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1090101141,"index":1179,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1090101142":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

At nearly -200 degrees Celsius, the methane is so viciously frigid that vacuum, the acme of pure cold, is actually keeping Maury warm: he wears a softsuit stuffed with microscopic layers of vacuum, packed in turn with crystalline nanostructures that prevent even light from crossing the gaps. This means the chill cannot get in… and his body heat cannot get out.\n\nSo, he is now baking to death in an ocean as cold as Dante's ninth. Of course, he could vent heat; the suit allows that. But the spreading warmth will force nitrogen out of the methane-ethane ocean, and the bubbles will slow him down. This is unacceptable for a lot of reasons, one of which is that he's already too slow. Liquid methane is about half as dense as water, so his huge fins and hissing thrusters struggle to push against it.\n\nAnother reason is that he will die if he can't get back inside in time.\n\n\"Maury,\" his sensorium whispers. He's turned the volume way down. \"Come back. This isn't worth your life.\"\n\nSorry, Mia, he thinks. It has to be worth my life, or I'm worth more than them, and I know I'm not. I put them there. It's my job to let them out.\n\nHe's always loved the stupid little swarmers.\n\nDome 2's understructure crouches around him, a maze of ultralight support struts and twisting bundles of cable. The shadow of a behemoth supercarrier blocks the dim sunlight above: he feels the thin howl of the ship's thrusters, fighting to move out of mooring at Dome 2 and haul another load of frozen people to an evacuation lifter. If Maury looks down, his lights illuminate a dusty wash of azotosomic plankton, primitive methane life. If he looks back to Dome 1, he can barely see the sleekly fat form of the Duiker, the water-ocean research submarine, docked to the arcology's underside. E. F. Babatunde is in there now, probably begging someone to tell them what's happening.\n\nHe heads down. His dolphins are already safe in open water. He has to get the swarmers out of their research pen.\n\n\"Tidal anchors decoupled,\" Xiana McCaig reports. \"Dome 1 substructure is as loose as I can make it. Dome 2 is showing temperature faults, but I've got drones on the way. Maury, please. We have no idea what'll happen when the quake hits. Get back in here!\"\n\n\"I'll be back in a few,\" he promises. \"I'm just going to cut the research pen open so the swarmers can get free—\"\n\n\"Oh, Allah,\" Ismail Barat whispers. \"It's gone.\"\n\n\"What's gone?\" Mia demands.\n\n\"The tidal pull. The ghost mass. It just… left. The moon is collapsing back to spheroid shape. I'm detecting primary waves in the subsurface ocean—it's a quake. It's a quake! Maury, get away from the substructure! Get clear!\"\n\nMaury imagines 60-plus meters of bulging moon, Titan's mass hauled up into a teardrop pointed at the sky—suddenly released. Smashing and scraping and grinding back into equilibrium. Cracks in the ice spewing plumes of water and ammonia. Continent-sized shelves slamming and rebounding and calving like bergs. The whole vast inner ocean sloshing back into its shape.\n\n\"The swarmers,\" he says, and he jettisons his buoyancy tanks.\n\nWithout that lift he is so much denser than the bad water around him that he plunges like a skydiver toward the cross brace below, where the swarmer pen is anchored. Titan's gravity may be gentle, but even gentle acceleration adds up. He hits hard, and the spinmetal surface blasts the air out of his lungs. He gasps and gags.

Not individually—not even at the hive level—but some kind of vast concert, conducted, perhaps, by leviathans down beneath the ice shell, communicating across the barrier by magnetic whisper that the swarmers receive via organic SQUIDs. An ecology spanning methane life and water-ammonia life. Why? How?\n\nMaury wants so badly to know. But if his curiosity brought the swarmers here, only for them to be caught in the quake, dashed apart against the arcology struts, he'll never forgive himself.\n\nHe should've set up a remote release, but he was complacent. He gets a fistful of the pen's smart plastic surface and fires the \"disintegrate\" signal through his glove. The polymer shreds and the swarmers scatter, their tiny bodies siphoning liquid methane as they pump down and away. Safe. Safe. \"I made it!\" he calls, jubilantly. \"On my way back up!\"\n\nThe quake hits.\n\nA hundred and fifty meters below, the icy basis of Kraken Mare rolls like liquid.

Something must've grown brittle. The snap is almost spinal. The smashed hulk of a drone tumbles past Maury as he tries to scull backward, away from the superdense arm of plasteel dropping like a guillotine through all-too-thin methane to strike him in the—\n\nAn absence.\n\nHe's on the ice seafloor, two hundred and forty meters down. Someone's shouting in his ear. It's Mia. She's always there in an emergency. Always there for her team. \"Maury! Maury, you're awake! Respond if able!\"\n\nHis sensorium tells him he's been in a medical coma while cytomachines fight to save his life. Massive blunt trauma. Concussion. The suit, as ever, tougher than the human being inside. Dome 2 has toppled partially; it's leaning toward the sea on damaged substructure. He should go help…\n\n\"Maury,\" Mia says, in a level voice he does not recognize. He's never heard her scared before. \"Listen to me. The quake is over. But a shelf of ice collapsed into Kraken Mare. The displacement wave is coming in now and you won't be safe on the bottom. You must reach the surface and get above wave level. That will be at least 50 meters.\"\n\nSurface? Wave? About 50 meters? Maury cues a blast of nootrope to clean up his thinking and grunts aloud in shock. He gets it. Oh, he gets it now, he has to RUN. \"I understand. I've lost my buoyancy. Ascending on thrusters.\"\n\nHe makes it to the surface. He's up there in plenty of time. He can even see Dome 1, still intact, though a lot of the surrounding rigging is damaged. One of the creepy Exo soldiers stands outside, beckoning to him with a laser dazzle, guiding him in.\n\nMaury opens his suit wings to their full membranous span. A single mighty stroke of paramuscle cups the air and hauls him up out of the sea. He's aloft! Titan air is thick, and Titan gravity is light, and like a huge bat he can fly. He puts his head down and starts building altitude, headed towards the beckoning Exo.\n\nThe Exo's laser blinks code at him. GO WITH GOD, YOU POOR—\n\nMaury looks back.\n\nFirst, he sees the supercarrier, tragically buoyant, tragically light, built for seas with gentle one-meter tides but now riding the greatest wave Titan has ever seen, directly into Dome 2's crippled understructure.

Individuals differ in their expression, but there's a clear trend when examined in the aggregate. Approximately eighty percent of the K1 crew is suffering similarly: intrusive thoughts, insomnia, narcolepsy, nightmares, and in the worst cases—as we saw with Helsha Rell—hallucinations, auditory and visual. It's a threat to the project.\"\n\n\"And the twenty percent?\"\n\n\"Individuals who've yet to be exposed. And yes, before you ask, I did witness the effect in action. I took the levels on an unexposed technician, Keleen Vance, and reexamined them after just an hour with it. Despite no outward changes of behavior, there was a marked drop in her serotonin and a commensurate rise in cortisol. After a week of work at Site 3, she was requesting sedatives as a sleep aid. Now she wants something stronger. Something to knock her out.\"\n\n\"Does your report include any recommendations?\"\n\n\"Only my best guess: Restrict direct exposure to thirty minutes per day, rotate teams between sites each week to limit proximity. And we need to plan for attrition. People need to get off this rock or they'll go crazy. Heck, I'm near the breaking point, and I'm supposed to help everyone else.\"\n\n\"I think you're right.

But I also know that it's frustrating to not be certain that our work is making a difference.

The science we invented will be used to propel humanity beyond our solar system and to new worlds.\n\n(Pause for applause)\n\nConstruction of the new colony ships has already begun. \n\n(Pause for applause)\n\nSome of you might want to join those missions.

It began as a gift, stolen from the Gardener. In efforts to understand the unknowable realities of the orb's incredible gifts, a signal was found—a repeating tune, the Song of Creation. Its frequencies were heard across the stars, wherever life's promise took hold. Some among the Ammonites worshipped it. Some among the Hive did the same. Still others sought to understand it that they might cage it, that they might control it—for to control life is to control death. Such ambition was not new; such ambition was as old as understanding. The melody was captured and studied. The frequencies replicated.\n\nBut the orb's mysteries were not so easily brought to light. The Song, for all its beauty, did not alone grant life. It was theorized that the Song was not a song at all, but many. That within its refrain, untold rhythms spoke their own truths, free and clear of the whole.\n\nCenturies passed. The Song remained untamed. Life moved on.\n\nSONG OF DEATH\n\nThe Choir formed in celebration of the Song. Performances marked the passage of seasons. But the Song's lie eventually began to corrupt the spirit of those who heard its tune. The melody was a reminder. The orb was a catalyst. And the Song was of the orb. Yet, those who embraced the Song were merely instruments and nothing more. Life remained beyond their grasp, while they remained ever in death's. Those of the Choir had given all of themselves. All was not enough.\n\nThe First Conductor was assassinated by one who sang an Aria of her own making. She, whose name has been stricken, had found notes hidden in the frequencies. Reversed and mirrored in pitch, she weaved them together and sang her beautiful abomination, until the Conductor wept and bled and screamed and fell. The Stricken fled, fearful of her crime. But others found promise anew in her art. The Stricken was captured and subjected to inquisition so that her song might be understood. This was before Understandings—before most things—when the first notes of a new Song were written.","name":"IX.I: The Unmaking","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/3479f3444a8efd669b3cde6d58962c91.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1529675531,"index":1221,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1529675528":{"displayProperties":{"description":"IN THESE NOTES, BEAUTIFUL OBLIVION\n\nThe war had raged for centuries. One of many. Just another. As irrelevant as the next. The stories of the Choir and their Deathsong were thought to be nothing more than folklore—wholly untrue at best, vastly exaggerated at worst… They were demons who'd sought life's gift, only to corrupt its beauty.\n\nThe homeworld of a species no longer on record—erased from the World's Grave, and thus from memory, as punishment for their transgressions—had kept itself safely removed from the battles being waged on the far side of their system. The location was safeguarded to protect the homeworld from the Hive's wrath. Its orbit was defended by an array of advanced offensive mechanics—cannons, mobile suits, mines, gravity slings, and more. They were protected. They were safe.\n\nThey never noticed the small crafts slip through their defenses. Twenty in total, landing in sequence at set coordinates along the planet's equator. Four trillions souls were about their days and nights as an unknown melody caught the breeze. It was beautiful—an ethereal gift and the end of all things. The Choir sang. Only twenty strong. As their voices grew in volume, the people started to scream. The planet's crust shifted and cracked. The seas roiled and spilled out over the land. The core shook. The ground shattered. Defenses scrambled. It was too late. Less than an hour after the Song began, the hidden homeworld of a forgotten people split in twain.

Angrier. Meaner.\n\nFor an instant, Malkanth worries Azavath's vessel will be unfit to contain their brother's rage.\n\nShe shoves the Severed Knight's essence into Azavath's empty shell.

He is ready to claim his crown.\n\nHashladûn considers him with disgust—he will never be a King, only ever a tool, blunt and brutal.\n\nShould he be anointed as a champion of the Pit… Should he be crowned… the Daughters' plots will be threatened before they ever truly begin.","name":"X: Faith in Bone","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/3479f3444a8efd669b3cde6d58962c91.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1529675529,"index":1223,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1529675534":{"displayProperties":{"description":"AS ABOVE…\n\nThe Butcher Queen of the slaughter pits rises to the first balcony, chest heaving and eyes thin with focus, baptized in a clinging muck of bone-dust clotted thick with gore.\n\nThe congregation is unsure what to make of the display.

The bodies of the truly unworthy litter their blood temples. Screams echo through the expanse. Akrazul and Azavath are one, and in that joining, he is no longer the same—Akrazul no more, only his anger remains.\n\nHe considers that the slaughter of the puppet masters was not part of Malkanth's plan.

Drawing daggers from their cloaks, Hashladûn, Besurith, Kinox, and Voshyr assassinate those they believe to be a threat to their schemes. Azavath will take the blame, and even if they are found out, there will be none left to challenge them.\n\nAS BELOW…\n\nA voice calls from the Pit.\n\nAzavath pauses her massacre.\n\nThe voice is familiar, yet strange—other.\n\nBelow, Malkanth hovers over the broken bodies that cover the ground.\n\nAzavath eyes her remaining victims and then turns to her sister.\n\nMalkanth calls again.\n\n\"Brother… I have need of you.\"\n\nAzavath leaves the high red perch, while the few remaining of the congregation flee, led by the Daughters, who feign distress.\n\nIn the Pit, Azavath considers Malkanth with care. The silent Deathsinger is confused, uncertain. Malkanth floats near, a gaping wound scarring her center, and whispers in her sister's ear…\n\n\"Our path is flawed. Your rage is a burden. Let me lift it from you…\"\n\nAs Malkanth sings a familiar song in an unfamiliar pitch, Azavath's eyes widen with recognition. She tries to speak but cannot, her voice having been shredded in her unmaking.\n\nThe song continues, and Azavath bleeds, from ear and nose and eye and mouth. Her bone cracks, and her flesh bubbles until she breaks. Malkanth smiles once more. The Deceiver's plan is unfulfilled, but there is victory in stalled sword logic.\n\nHashladûn peers into the Pit as the last of the congregation make their escape. Zulmak is defeated, the new champion shattered. There are none to claim the logic's prize. The Daughters' plans to return their father to glory is no longer threatened.\n\nAnd, as it was before it all began, all that remains are failed sword logic and the unknown promise of nightmares.","name":"XI: The Anti-Logic","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/3479f3444a8efd669b3cde6d58962c91.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1529675534,"index":1224,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1529675535":{"displayProperties":{"description":"WHISPERS OF DISSENT\n\n\"Listen close, o Sister of the Song, o Singer of Despair, o Bringer of Death!\n\"Your Song is not yet sung.\n\"Your purpose, yet seized.\n\"Are you violence?

Yet, you would allow poor, sweet Azavath to give all of herself for you—to extinguish her essence that you might take her place. But her essence is not the whole of it. What of her gift? The melody that echoes in her soul is a rare treasure. So few are as purely connected to the pain of our being as those worthy of the Choir. Still, precious Azavath gives everything for you to be whole, trading her art for your rage, when rage is so easily born, so readily nurtured, so pathetically revered. But… such is the depth of her caring. Such is the folly of love, that we would surrender the best of our being, the entirety of our existence, to please those we cherish most. What, then, of the other—your wicked sister, Malkanth? Her fondness for you is tempered by ambition—by the stoic truth she finds in sword logic. She sees all, knows much, and wields secrets as weapons like few before her. That she herself holds you dear is a certainty you feel to your core. For she is—has always been—devout and true. She served the fallen Prince faithfully, despite the questionable calling of your line. But her loyalties were of little consequence when the Children of Light cursed these halls and slaughtered their way to forbidden chambers where they killed the son, tempted the father, and set in motion a war that would end a King's reign. But you know all of this, great and powerful Akrazul. Such histories are the framework for your rage. Such violent truths are marked upon your body, mind, and soul. Your severing is the culmination of a lifetime fighting to prove not just your own worth, but the worth of all bound to the tainted sect of your disgraced brood. I wonder… Did Malkanth ever offer to restore your loving sister? Your body will rest hollow when your soul is freed. Why, then, must Azavath perish when a vessel of her own blood and bone sits idle? Because, angry, blind, sad Akrazul, your sister knows what you do not: You are a tool. A weapon. Nothing more. Your rage—your sole value. Azavath would have seen different. She would have smiled at your renewed pride once you were made whole in her flesh, but soon your anger would have been more than she could bear. And so, there it is… the broken siblings blinded by their sinful desires. One—Malkanth, the liar—would see you sharpened and loosed upon those she deems weak, but at the cost of the only living creature you hold dear. The other—tender, loving Azavath—would bind your fury within her love, making you lesser as she attempts to nurture your pain. Both are flawed. Both as unworthy as any. What then will you do? Once whole, will you remain a puppet to a would-be puppet master? Or will you take your sister's gift and become your final, fleeting shape—rage unleashed, and nothing more, until all are dust?\"\n\nThese words became a steady hum picking at the back of Akrazul's mind.\n\nHe did not hear them—but felt them.\n\nThey etched a truth upon his being in the instant between Azavath's final scream and his own rending.\n\nAll went dark and gray and then he gasped anew—his first breath in his sister's shell—and through new eyes, he saw Malkanth smiling down on him and knew the whispers were not deceit, but a promise.\n\nThe edge of his blade slid into Malkanth's sternum—a fatal wound, deep and clean.\n\nAkrazul, now Azavath, would be no one's pawn.\n\nHer rage would be unfettered.\n\nThe Swarm would suffer.\n\nThen, the wicked offspring of the Light would, too, and any others who stood before her.\n\nThe coming slaughter would end only in dust—hers or all others'.","name":"IX.X: Apocrypha","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/3479f3444a8efd669b3cde6d58962c91.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1529675532,"index":1226,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1529675533":{"displayProperties":{"description":"NO GODS, ONLY DEVILS\n\nMalkanth feels herself slide free from her body.\nThe exorcism is sudden and effortless.\n\nThen come the whispers…\n\n\"I stoked your brother's fire—riled him that he might strike.\n\"I needed only the wound to tear you free.\n\"The piercing of your heart will take some mending, but your vessel is fit for what is to come.\n\"I know this comes as a shock, but trust that my actions were such that you felt only the briefest pain as the edge broke through, and now this…\n\"Now, peace.\"\n\n\"I asked not for peace, o hidden Sister of Shapes.\"\n\n\"You know this voice?\"\n\n\"I know you have many.\n\"I have heard their faint temptations since I was a child.\n\"Never have I sought their counsel.\"\n\n\"You have asked for nothing, this is true.\n\"You sought only to take.\n\"You are a willful, treacherous thing.\n\"I quite like you.\n\"Make no mistake, I see no fault in your desires, nor the attempt to see them realized.\n\"Your only sin, in the eyes of those who matter, was that you were not yet positioned to achieve the full extent of your potential.\n\"You saw a moment and you moved to act, like countless others before you.\n\"But your action was not enough.\n\"Worse—it was limited in its view of the power hidden so plainly within your grasp.\"\n\n\"Akrazul is a force worthy of change.

It was under our noses the whole time.\n\nSomething lies deep below the Moon's surface, and I believe it's more important than we initially believed. It's something we may not be ready for—I've found a Pyramid, akin to your description. It's what we've been hunting for.\n\nThe Pyramid has reopened a box in my mind, long thought locked, its contents frightening and heartbreaking. It's forcing me to confront memories buried ages ago. People, places, vile creatures—all are rushing to the forefront of my consciousness. If it's affecting me like this, what will it do to our loved ones, those we've sworn to protect?\n\nI vividly remember the stories from that night. The sky burning green, the roar of thunder ripping through the darkness, and the Eater of Hope tearing through our ranks. Crota, the merciless Hive prince whose dark campaign to pursue the Traveler led to the slaughter of countless worlds—all in the name of his father, Oryx, the Taken King.\n\nI'll never forget the Vanguard's failed attempt to reclaim the Moon from the Hive. The Great Disaster. We lost thousands, needlessly. I fear we are on the verge of doing so once again.\n\nNow the Hive are spreading across the Moon, perhaps mounting a defensive or some other insidious machination. We must access the inside of the Pyramid by whatever means necessary, to find what I believe may be the key to our battle with the Darkness. It's too critical to allow the Hive to interfere.\n\nThis is our duty. My fate has guided me here. We will set it right. The price will be high, but the alternative is not an option. It will take the collective might of all Guardians working together to lead us to a brighter future.","name":"Regarding the Great Disaster","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/89cb21fcb08b92d29d87b54d64dafcbd.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":9250518,"index":1240,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"9250519":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Ikora,\n\nThe Nightmares appear to be extracted from our very psyche—violent manifestations that wreak havoc, tormenting us with our past trauma. They tease us with a life we once knew, prying into our minds and attacking our most vulnerable points. This assault on our emotions is aimed to weaken us and our sense of purpose. But I will not waver. Emotions can be overcome. I don't fully comprehend the power these Nightmares wield, or if they can truly be conquered, but I have yet to meet an enemy who could not be.\n\nI cannot shake the feeling that we are being toyed with, that these Nightmares are a hindrance to our goal. We must not lose sight of what they are guarding.\n\nPerhaps they wish to make us question ourselves and our will to fight, to overcome. Now, I lived in the darkness for years, barely escaping with what was left of my life. The toll it took on me to refortify myself is something I refuse to experience again. If the Pyramid is indeed testing us, it will find we are more than up to the challenge.\n\nThe Pyramid has also spawned another entity, one that presents a different kind of danger. It does not attempt to harm me physically. Instead, it seeks to wage psychological warfare—a battlefield I have lived on. The Pyramid had the gall to bring Sai Mota before me, devoid of her corporeal form, hoping to shake my resolve.\n\nI will admit, seeing this phantom was jarring, but the Pyramid underestimates my will. It was almost comforting to see her again. Nothing will break my determination. I can't allow it. Not with what's at stake.\n\nShould we falter, all our work—along with our goal of an existence without strife, pain, or hardship—will cease to be.

It was only Sai at first. Now Vell Tarlowe joins her, back to torture me. Once more, I'm forced to relive the loss of my old fireteam. Their screams of agony haunted me for so long, but never did I anticipate hearing their voices again. The Darkness is deceptive and seeks to corrupt from within. It knows just where to strike.\n\nTerrible pain has resurfaced from a scar that I assumed had healed. Now something is scratching and clawing its way out. When we went after Crota to seek retribution for the Great Disaster, we knew there would be risks. We did not know it would be a suicide mission. I'm ashamed to say I never wanted to think about these events again. How can we move on from our past if we continue to live in it?\n\nThey were the last family I had before my time in the Dark.\n\nSix of us went in. Only I made it out.\n\nEriana-3, my leader—our first encounter consisted of an argument over a piece of music I loathed. Eriana was enamored with its melody and sought to convince me of its merits. Her unequivocal honesty in the face of dissenting opinions led me to pledge my total devotion and trust to her. I would hum the tune quietly to myself in the Dark, to stave off the madness that was consuming me.\n\nOur Titan, Vell, was the first to fall. I mourn him to this day and think of his courage in times of despair. We should all be so valiant in the face of overwhelming odds. Today, I will need his example more than ever.\n\nSai's knives were as sharp as her wit. She laughed in the very face of danger. Now, the same laugh that I heard countless times and that once brought me great comfort rings painfully in my memory and triggers nothing but anguish. How I wish I could amend that! She deserved more.\n\nPoor Omar was skeptical of our chances, yet his bravery endured—even as his Light was pulled from him by the Hive Wizard, the Heart of Crota. Few possess the fortitude required to press on when all hope seems lost. He has imbued me with the strength to weather the coming storm.\n\nAnd you know Toland, the Shattered—the mad Warlock who knew more than he let on. I had my doubts about him in the past, but time changes perspectives. I now respect his dedication to learning the ways of the Darkness and surviving despite them, much as I had to.\n\nBy confronting me with my lost fireteam and stirring up memories so painful, the Nightmares only confirm my earlier assumptions—I feel they are trying to distract us.\n\nRemain vigilant, no matter the cost.","name":"Regarding Eris's Fireteam","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/89cb21fcb08b92d29d87b54d64dafcbd.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":9250516,"index":1242,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"9250517":{"displayProperties":{"description":"My Queen,\n\nOmnigul.\n\nThe monster Crota's sycophantic zealot.

Oddly, I find myself thinking of him more now that he is gone. I suppose I've grown closer to other Guardians and the Vanguard than I realized.

The Hidden Swarm that previously served Crota has banded together once again, leaderless but not purposeless. The energy emanating from the Pyramid has apparently attracted undesirable attention. If I am struggling to understand its potential, I wonder whether the Hidden Swarm has even scratched the surface.\n\nNonetheless, the Pyramid arrived on the Moon well before Guardians set foot here and remained unseen by us for eons. I spent years trapped in the Hellmouth, and all the while this force was buried beneath me, hidden by the Hive. If only I had known. How long has the Hidden Swarm been experimenting with the Pyramid's power? For all the Hive's efforts, they fortunately do not seem to have succeeded in penetrating the Pyramid's walls.\n\nNow that the Pyramid has activated, I sense a certain desperation in the Hidden Swarm. The Hive are frenzied. Their rituals and the appearance of Crota's daughter, Hashladûn, suggest that either the Hidden Swarm is seeking leadership, or it is so malleable that anyone desiring an army might claim them.\n\nWe cannot underestimate the Hidden Swarm. I know far too well what kind of damage these Hive are capable of. Too many victims have fallen to their bloodlust. I've… lost too much. Because of them, I lost my Ghost. I lost my eyes. They assumed me beaten. But they were wrong. I used their own dark magic against them, surviving and learning their tricks. I know where they are weak, a place only mentioned in whispers: the Catacombs. It is there that unknown shadows lurk, performing the most depraved rituals imaginable.\n\nShould some malignant force rise from the Darkness to guide them, I shudder to think what this brood could achieve. This must never be allowed to happen. The Hive may have suffered a momentary loss and could attempt retaliation, but now is our time to strike. No more distractions.

We can provide a distraction of our own while I focus my attention where it is most desperately needed: uncovering the secrets inside the Pyramid. I sense there could be a greater danger lurking in the darkness, and the Pyramid may just be our key to stopping it.\n\nEvery moment that goes by, we become more vulnerable, and our allies further endangered.

The Nightmare of Ghaul is an unwelcome reminder of the slaughter we faced. Many of us are still rebuilding after the atrocities committed by this murderous fiend. He orchestrated one of the greatest tragedies our people have endured when he tried to steal the Traveler for himself and harness its Light, destroying our homes and the Tower, massacring thousands of innocents in the process.\n\nGhaul's most odious transgression was not his attempted theft of the Traveler, nor his part in the Speaker's death, but his profane, self-aggrandized fantasy that he would be chosen to receive the Traveler's Light. It would amuse me to think this brute, who excelled only at betrayal and subterfuge, would ever be worthy of the Traveler's Light, had his misguided campaign not led to so much senseless bloodshed.\n\nLight stands for self-sacrifice and devotion. Light is the hope of a peaceful, harmonious world. Ghaul sought only power. He would never have been chosen for the Light.\n\nI often wonder whether I was chosen, or whether I made a choice in my journey through this life. Did fate make me, or did I make my own fate? I cannot say with great certainty, one way or the other. I can only assert that I choose what I feel to be right in any given moment and hope I made the right choice.\n\nI was relieved when Ghaul was defeated by the might of Guardians and destroyed by the Traveler's Light. It was reaffirming. I spare no pity for Ghaul, as he was a wretched creature who got what he deserved. His rage-fueled quest for power will not prove our greatest test, however.

So he's always alone now, except for his Ghost.\n\nOne night, he sits with his head against his knees and listens to the distant snaps of gunfire. He hasn't seen anyone in about a week, but he can hear them. Somehow that makes the loneliness worse. More potent.\n\n\"Did you know,\" his Ghost says, bright but gentle. The purple glint of his shell reflects the half-light outside the crate. \"That in the Last City, they are celebrating? They call it the Dawning.

Guardians do not have true fathers. Some might say Guardians do not have true family. We are born with no one but our Ghosts, and we find our way to something more. I was lucky to find my way to a family. A family I chose for myself.\n\nI was drawn to the Speaker because of the vision he had for this City. He helped me understand that we fight not for the sake of fighting, but for the sake of the people. He taught me to imagine a day where we might put down our weapons and that reaching that day would be our greatest victory yet. I have worked for that day all my life.\n\nThe Speaker was a leader in this City. He was here at its formation. He helped establish the Consensus. Most importantly, he was a figure that people could recognize and trust. Because of him, that is what I aspire to be as well: a familiar face who reminds people that they are safe. That they are taken care of.\n\nIt is painful for me—and for all of us—that we could not be there during the Speaker's last moments. As Guardians, it is the nature of our long lives that we see many people die. We hope that, through our service, we can give them peaceful deaths. At the very least, we know that the Speaker died bravely. We know that he died with the City, the people, and the Traveler in his mind. We know that his last moments were a testament to everything this City stands for: bravery in the face of adversity and dedication to our principles when faced with those who would do us harm.\n\nWe cannot reclaim what we have lost. There will always be a void that the Speaker once filled. We cannot replace him.\n\nBut I hope, someday, we may find someone to continue his work.\n\nFather, I will miss you.

The first time I saw them, I thought they were surveillance drones, but up close, they were nothing like our old technology, not really. The way they move seems organic and natural. They spin their shells like they are ruffling feathers; their little forward-facing lights blink like eyes.\n\n\"We're called Ghosts,\" one of them said to me once, hovering at my shoulder as I tended a cook-fire.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, gentle, casual. They're all different, these Ghosts. Many of them are like children, curious and friendly. Some are world-weary from the moment they're born.\n\nThe Ghost spun his silver petals, considering. \"Because we're searching, I think.\"\n\nIt's a good enough answer for me. I'm searching, too.\n\nI let the little Ghosts follow me. We talk about what the Traveler was like before the Collapse. They like to hear it, and I like to remember. Deep in their core, they remember, too, I think. They remember a time when they were all one piece. Still, they like to ask what the Traveler told me, and I recount all the dreams I can still remember. I haven't dreamed since the Collapse, and this is almost—almost, almost—like dreaming again.\n\nToday, at twilight, one of the shy and quiet Ghosts who has been lingering at my side asks if I will follow her out into the valley. I should say no, but she sounds hopeful. And I am curious.\n\nWe travel for several hours. The land here is recovering—not just from the Collapse, but from the time before it. Resources for our settlement are scarce, but nature is creeping back in, and nature is cruel now. It's been starving and confused for decades, jostled out of its natural order, and now we reap the consequences. Wolves steal our livestock. Mange-ridden bears wander through our compound late at night, pawing at our doors. The land is so thick with the memory of poison that it won't grow crops.\n\nWe protect ourselves from this recovering world as best we can, and we rarely go out at night. But I'm drawn by a curiosity that feels beyond me.\n\nThe Ghost leads me to a barn with a sagging roof. She asks me to wait out of sight—she says, \"I think you'll scare her.\" I don't fully understand what she means.\n\nI crouch and watch as she hovers over the years-old remains of a person, barely recognizable as something that was once living. The Ghost floats over the body nervously, and then scans it with pale light. In front of my eyes, flesh grows over old bones and tattered rags stitch themselves together. The person, a woman, gasps and sits up.\n\nI can't believe it.\n\nThe Ghost hovers close to her new companion and says something quiet and reassuring. I can't hear. I feel amazed, and then jealous, and then ashamed.","name":"Waking","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/081eeed938667d283521982c8ca7bbd6.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2286251484,"index":1297,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2286251483":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I am the first Speaker to be taken prisoner.\n\nThe greatest surprise isn't being captured; it's being captured by a Dreg.\n\nIn the end, when they drag me, tied and bound, into a damp cave miles out from my settlement, it's three Dregs. I look around for a Kell or a Priest—someone in charge—but we're alone. There are no Pikes or Ether tanks, no banners, no Servitors. I sit on a rock and look at my captors, more perplexed than afraid.\n\nThe shame of being captured by something so little and young-looking, when for so long we've managed to defend our settlement from their hulking Captains, is a little bit humbling.\n\nThe Dreg who grabbed me fidgets with a mask. One of his companions watches, while the other half-heartedly points an Arc spear at me. They seem uncertain. Nervous. Probably they weren't supposed to have done this.\n\nI wait patiently until the Dreg straps the mask to his face.\n\n\"You,\" he says in a crackling, distorted voice. I'm floored. They've managed to make a translator. \"You are the mouth of the Great Machine.\"\n\nThere have been negotiations with the Fallen since they arrived on Earth. Never successful, nearly always fatal, but they've happened. So I'm aware that some of the Risen know their alien language, and some of the high-level Fallen know ours. Dregs, though. It's another surprise.\n\nAnd… the \"mouth of the Great Machine\"…\n\nHm.\n\n\"I was,\" I say carefully. The Dreg narrows all four of his eyes as his tech translates my words. If he understands the distinction between \"I am\" and \"I was,\" he doesn't show it. Instead, he nods.\n\n\"You will tell us the Great Machine's words.\"\n\nIt doesn't actually sound like a command. I wonder if, with better translation tech, he would've said \"please.\"\n\nI don't say anything. If I reveal what I can't do, what I don't know, they'll probably kill me.\n\nThe other two Dregs gather around their companion, watching him eagerly. Now and then, they look at me. The one holding the spear has let her grip grow slack, and the spear is tipped down to point at the ground. The Fallen have surprisingly expressive faces. What I pick up from them is not aggression or hatred, but fearful anticipation.\n\nThe Dreg with the mask nods again, not discouraged by my silence. This time, when he speaks, I can hear his hope, even through the mask: \"Why did the Great Machine leave us?\"\n\nI stare back at him.\n\nAny fear I felt before dissipates. Instead, what I feel is a grief partially forgotten in the chaos of trying to survive—and a deep and abiding kinship with the enemies who have pursued us.\n\nMy voice is very quiet when I finally speak.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nThe other two Dregs look at their friend, waiting.

In the days following the Collapse, any Speakers who survived were scattered to the wind, traveling with groups of refugees across the ruined wasteland that Earth became. Aside from the man who taught me, I've never met another Speaker in my life. For all I know, I'm the last one alive.\n\nBefore the Collapse, Speakers were chosen for their ability to hear the Traveler through detailed, lucid dreams. Since the dreams have stopped, there are other signs. Ghosts follow us. When we do dream, we see a strange and blinding white light. We are prone to headaches.\n\nMy mentor couldn't teach me how to interpret dreams, so he taught me in hypotheticals. I had to imagine what the dreams might be like. I had to speculate why the Traveler might come back to us and when. Like all Speakers, I memorized the four tenets: The Traveler is good. The Traveler is sentient. The Traveler will save us. The Traveler will leave us.\n\nSometimes I worry the Traveler has already left us.\n\nMy mentor died of a wasting sickness two years ago, and I've tried to live as his replacement. But where he was a living memory of when the Traveler was awake, I have only his memories, secondhand, imperfectly understood. I can't give answers. I can't make the Traveler speak.\n\nOr, at least, I couldn't.\n\nFor weeks, I have worked in secret on a project, gathering scrap metal and old, broken things left over from the time before. I've cobbled it together, tinkered with the mix of strange and half-understood technology, tried to calibrate it to my needs.\n\nA long time ago, long before the Collapse, astrophysicists recorded sounds from the planets in our solar system and turned them into music. They translated plasma waves and radio emissions into eerie, musical rumbles, roars, whistles, and hisses. The Traveler makes sounds, too. Speakers have listened to its music for many years, in the form of dreams.\n\nCarefully, lovingly, I build a mask. An amplifier.\n\nNo one knows about it but me. I won't get their hopes up, even though mine are sky high as I put the finishing touches on it. It's not beautiful like our old technology was. It is scuffed and bent and rusted, like everything we own now. But if I'm right, if I can do this, it will do beautiful things.\n\nI can't bear to fail. I have failed at everything else so far.\n\nWhen I'm finished, I wear the mask. Pieces of it, not sanded down, are rough and sharp against my face, but I dream for the first time in my life.\n\n|| I have cried out unheard for so long that my voice is raw. ||","name":"Singing","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/081eeed938667d283521982c8ca7bbd6.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2286251482,"index":1299,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2286251481":{"displayProperties":{"description":"You are the last remaining star.\n\nIn your dreams, you see yourself suspended in bright but flickering Light, staring out over a world half-destroyed.

The elation of success. The pain of failure. The candle-snuff of death. The gasping of rebirth. You feel it all at once.\n\n---\n\nI am the last Speaker.\n\nI am the child of two self-exiles, and I live in a settlement in the shadow of a looming mountain. There are about three hundred of us, and we've lived here for nearly seven years. When we first arrived, we were under the jurisdiction of a Warlord named Cathal. He offered us protection for a high price, requisitioning a third of our supplies and conscripting nearly half our people to his cause. The actual protection he provided was limited. The Warlords used our valley like a battlefield, crashing through like giants who couldn't see the lives they were ending. But they could. They saw us. They just didn't care.\n\nThe Iron Lords drove Cathal out nearly a year ago, and we've lived in comfortable independence since then, with little oversight from our Risen saviors. Our people voted for that. The Iron Lords saved us, but they would be no different from the Warlords if they also wished to rule us.\n\nNow I sit in negotiations with one of them, a woman named Lady Efrideet.\n\n\"You're free to decide either way,\" she says. \"But if you say yes, you'll have an armed escort.\"\n\nThree other people sit with me: our elected mayor, our most experienced physician, and our oldest resident. We are the people our settlement chose as representation. Beside me, a silver Ghost spins his shell, floating at my shoulder, watching Efrideet. He's followed me for over a year now, and still hasn't found his chosen. He's good company.\n\n|| I have given so much of myself already, but I give more. I become a beacon. I call my children home. ||\n\n\"A consolidated population like that, all in one place,\" our mayor says. She sounds weary. She's been in her position for nearly sixty years. \"It would draw Warlords to us like flies.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about the Warlords,\" Efrideet says, with the cool assurance of someone who only half-understands our worry to begin with. \"Their days are numbered. Their way of life is incompatible with the Iron Decree, and so…\" She shrugs.\n\nHer nonchalance is unrelatable, but I think I trust her. I trust the Iron Lords. They've given us little reason to doubt them.\n\n\"How would the city be governed?\" I ask.\n\nEfrideet shrugs again. \"That seems like the kind of thing you put to a vote.\" She taps her fingers on the table, impatient, but only a little. \"We'll just build the place and bring people there. We can defend the walls, but we're not going to dictate what happens inside them. This is a joint venture. A collaboration.\"\n\nMy companions exchange looks, considering.\n\nEfrideet watches us. Like most of the Risen, she tries to look impassive. Unaffected. But if you listen closely, she's trying to convince us. She wants this. \"Listen,\" she says. \"Risen and non-Risen have lived in their separate corners for too long. We're all people. That's all the Iron Lords are trying to say. We should live together.\" She pauses. \"There are things we can teach each other.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, once we've packed up everything we can carry, we leave for the place where we'll build the Last Safe City of Earth.\n\n|| I wish for something to grow in my shadow. ||","name":"Building","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/081eeed938667d283521982c8ca7bbd6.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2286251481,"index":1300,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2286251480":{"displayProperties":{"description":"You are waiting for something to happen.\n\nYou are suspended and weightless, but so heavy in your heart.

It only understands a fraction of your words, but it tries, and that has to be enough.\n\nLife goes on beyond your control, as it always has. That is the curse of your creation. The things you build are not your own.\n\nAnd then another star blinks into existence.\n\n---\n\nI am the last Speaker, and I sit at a table with the Vanguard while the City around us fights over nothing.\n\n\"We built this City to find some kind of unity,\" Tallulah says. She has her hands on the table and is leaning forward, like she might jump over it. \"We're breaking apart from the inside.\"\n\nSilence falls over the room. I am trying to think.\n\n\"What does the Traveler say?\" Saint-14 asks, quietly. Everyone looks at me.\n\nI breathe in through my nose, breathe out slowly. \"About the factions?\" I ask. \"Or about people killing each other in our streets? This is not what the Traveler wanted. That much I can tell you.\"\n\n\"That was the direct result of creating us,\" Osiris says, leaning back in his seat. He is stone-faced, as always. \"Violence. Does the Traveler truly know what it wants?\"\n\nI try to hide my frustration, and I'm glad my face is hidden by my mask.\n\nThe truth is this: I cannot say for certain what the Traveler wants, or whether it knows what it wants. The Traveler does not speak to me in words, but in dreams. Dream language is cramped. The messages come from the Traveler, disintegrate on the way to me, and reform into something else. I am an interpreter more than a Speaker.\n\nBut uncertainty has been the death of us before, and it will be again if we are not vigilant.\n\nSo what I say is, \"The Traveler has always wanted to protect humanity, on its own or through Guardians. We need to enact that will.\"\n\n\"With all due respect to both of you,\" Tallulah says, eyeing Osiris and me. \"This isn't about the Traveler. This is about what happens when people come together without anyone to really lead them.\" She taps her foot. She's nervous. Unusual for Tallulah. \"Let this go on a little longer, and this is the same as the Dark Age. It's just Warlords, packed into a tighter pen.\"\n\n\"A body of representatives would help,\" Saint-14 says. \"Something to allow all sides to be heard.\"\n\n\"Every side has a voice, but not all voices should be given the same weight,\" I say, shaking my head. \"Some of these ideas are dangerous. We should determine which factions can continue to exist, and give them an official channel through which to air their grievances and pursue their needs.\"\n\n\"Which ideas are dangerous, Speaker?\" Osiris asks. He is watching me, steadily. \"And who decides that?\"\n\n\"This is not a fight,\" Saint-14 says. \"We have enough of those ahead of us.\"\n\n\"We will hear from each of the factions,\" I say, ignoring Osiris. Some decision is better than no decision. \"Give them the opportunity to plead their case, save for those who have resorted to outright violence.\"\n\n\"Well, then we've got to get rid of Echelon South, for one,\" Tallulah lists, counting on her fingers. \"And those Binary Star idiots, too. Trinary? Binary? Whatever. Anyway, there are plenty of fingers pointed at this new group, too. Monarchy something.\"\n\n\"If anyone can prove the rumors, we exile their leaders,\" I say, holding up my hand. \"The factions that stay will argue their case. Of those that have a valuable viewpoint to bring to the governance of the City, we create a council.\"\n\n\"This sets a dangerous precedent, Speaker,\" Osiris says.

I stand on the balcony of my small apartment with Lady Efrideet, who wishes to leave the Last Safe City of Earth.\n\n\"I suppose I can't convince you to stay.\"\n\nEfrideet stands with her arms crossed, looking out over the City. \"No,\" she says.\n\n\"And you certainly don't need to ask permission.\"\n\nShe laughs, just a little. \"No.\" She leans out over the balcony railing, looking down. Guardians have no fear of heights. She would probably happily hang over the rail by her ankles if the mood struck her. \"But I was thinking about what you said before.\" She turns to look at me, but the featureless mask serves me once more, betraying nothing. \"About finding the next Speaker.\"\n\nAh.\n\nI've been waiting for decades for someone to come to me, to tell me their child is having strange, blinding dreams and headaches. To see a Guardian stroll through the Tower, flocked by unpaired Ghosts. I've interviewed hundreds of people via long-distance comms. I've consulted the Traveler. I've walked daily among the crowds of civilians and Guardians at the entrance of the City. And still, I've found no one I can hand down my mask to. \n\nBefore Saint-14 left for Mercury, I'd thought that maybe he could take my place. That I might be able to teach him. That's not the way it's usually done, but he has such a gentle heart. He has the right temperament. Sometimes I think he's better suited to it than I am.\n\nBut he hasn't come back.\n\nI clear my throat. \"Yes,\" I say. \"Right. I still haven't found them. But I know they're out there.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Efrideet says. \"I'm going 'out there.' I can look.\"\n\nIt's a good offer. But I am still waiting for him to come back, all the same.\n\n\"That's why you want to leave the City?\" I ask instead of condoning the proposal. \"You're the one who convinced me to come here.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I did,\" she says, lifting her chin. \"But no, that's not it. There's something about this life that isn't… working for me.

Hundreds of years of pointing and shooting, Speaker…\" She shakes her head. \"I don't know what it is yet, but I want to find a different way.\"\n\nThis conversation feels so familiar. I was so young the last time we had it.\n\n\"I understand,\" I say, softer now. \"That's a noble cause.\"\n\nShe shrugs. \"And maybe I come back with a little baby Speaker.\"\n\nShe doesn't say it, but the \"if I come back at all\" hangs in the air between us.\n\n\"I would appreciate your help,\" I say finally. \"I can't wear this mask forever.\"","name":"Searching","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/081eeed938667d283521982c8ca7bbd6.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2286251479,"index":1302,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2286251478":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Something terrible is going to happen.\n\nIn this dream, a horrible, brutal hand stretches toward you.

This is not what you deserve.\n\nThe fear is enough to make you want to leave.\n\n---\n\nI am the last Speaker, and I dream that the Traveler will leave us.\n\nIt shouldn't be a surprise. This truth has been passed down from Speaker to Speaker for generations: the Traveler is good, the Traveler is sentient, the Traveler will save us, and the Traveler will leave us. For many, many years, I believed that the prophecy of the Traveler's departure was misinterpreted, and fulfilled instead by its silence after the Collapse. I stopped preaching that final tenet. It only served to frighten people.\n\nMy dreams, which have always been infrequent and fleeting, come more regularly. They are more confusing than ever, more disruptive. I once so rarely dreamed while awake, but now it happens all the time.\n\n|| I am silent again. I am gone.

There will be fear and anger and violence, all based on a dream I can't explain or verify with proof.\n\nIf I can understand this better, if I can make sense of it, then I can fix it. Surely.\n\nSo I go on as if nothing has happened. I attend Consensus meetings. I discuss Hidden intelligence with Ikora. I receive reports and news from our scouts outside the City, and I consult with Zavala. People come to me with questions, as always. They ask how to cope with loss, and change, and fear—all daily realities of this life. They ask how to cope with doubt.\n\nI lie through my teeth and tell them to trust in the Traveler.\n\n|| Empty.

Strikes of gnarled charge nipped scorch into the dirt with terrifying frequency as the sky rippled with lightning. Tohr's withered husk remained in meditative stillness, long dead, basking in the metronomic glow of each flashing termination. The armor around his corpse let slip a glint of light, pulsing like a guiding bannerette for thrill seekers.

Salt-blasted dirt gave way underfoot, in places, while spindles of thatch-work glass weave held strong against her weight in others. She could feel static flow through the network of crystalline connections like conduits aching to reach out and touch the storm. Her Light shivered, welcoming the Arc surges that leapt up metal clasps on her boots, and she threw herself to another glossy foothold as a bolt dove to meet ground.\n\nThe Maelstrom calmed as she reached Tohr's body. A staff lay at his feet. The air was a screen of charged pressure around him, but Tyv knew how to find gaps. She knew how to bend away the lightning and loop Arc into itself. Lessons the Light had taught her. She slipped her hand through the barrier and lifted the plate from Tohr. She inhaled ozone and humidity and slid the Harness onto her shoulders.\n\nRoars thundered from overhead and bolts scattered across Tohr's hill.

Somewhere underneath what had been called the Lighthouse, a small chapel had been erected in which an open book lay lonesome upon a lectern overlooking a middling number of pews. He could hear a cast of attendees shifting in their seats from time to time, but mostly he heard wind and stillness. Vance had arrived early in the morning—as much as morning remained a concept on this blasted planetary waste. His impatience was starting to sweat through his face, loosed by doubt, time, and the meddling of his own thoughts. He feared the others would notice and pulled a small square of cloth to dab away the perspiration. No one seemed to know he was coming.\n\nHe had yet to see Osiris, and none had spoken of the prophet beyond cryptic phrases or referencing texts he already knew. Vance faced back toward the haggard door that kept dust and sand from whisking into the Spire Chapel. He no longer felt sunlight casting through it as he had when he first sat down. Vance gripped the pew, preparing to leave.\n\nWhispers trickled from a passage at the front of the chapel like drips of condensation falling on echoing stone floors. The passage was small but twisted downward, deeper still than they already were. Vance could not see where it led, but from it, he heard measured steps and metallic chimes. A robed figure draped in symbology and smelling of fern emerged from the passage, flanked by two Guardians trimmed in gold. One carried the scent of warmth. The other, ozone and tang.\n\n\"You are all in attendance to hear of our findings: The next directive brought to us through the divination of Osiris's own hand. I have seen his words, and I believe it is important for us to remember why we followed his path before we look to the future.\"\n\nVance removed his hands from the pew and slid them into his lap. His eyes jittered in blackness behind a fresh cloth wrap, waiting for clarity. The two Guardians circled the chapel, lighting candles and torches that billowed incense. The air thickened.\n\n\"Osiris tells us that the Darkness will return; that the Darkness will rise and choose its champions. Tells us that we must look beyond ourselves, beyond the City, if we are to combat such an evil. The Traveler alone will not save us. We are meant to save the Traveler and all of its people.\"\n\nVance could not help his outburst. \"The very same who would have cast us out? Who exiled the prophet?\"\n\nSister Faora allowed the murmurs to rise, simmer, and rest before speaking.\n\n\"The Lightless are filled with fear. Fear is a seed of Darkness, working to compel them to its ends. Osiris sought the truth between the Light and the Dark through death and study. For their fear of his revelations, they cast him out.\" The laity nodded in agreement, and Faora continued. \"The Speaker wishes to remain in ignorance, but ignorance is the shadow that welcomes in the night. It is the drop below the horizon where a star sinks into surrender. Lightless. We will not allow such a fate. Not here.\"\n\nSister Faora takes a deep breath.\n\n\"We must remain vigilant if we are to protect all the Light has touched.\" The proselytizing figure steps from the lectern. \"You arrived only hours ago. Did you not, Brother? I believe I witnessed your arrival.\"\n\nHe did not think his presence worth noting. \"I did my…\"\n\n\"Sister Faora, Superior.\"\n\n\"Of course, Sister.\" He should have known from her authoritative tone. \"I have come to learn.\"\n\n\"Then your first lesson is this: Listen. The choice to close their ears is what drove the City to fail. It is why we must conduct our work here. It is why without us, their walls will be for nothing.\"\n\nVance fell silent. Sister Faora let his submission linger and then continued.\n\n\"Each Risen Lightbearer, each Guardian is Light made flesh by the Traveler. They are Light, and Light is wielded. When we refuse to wield the Light as needed, we give ground to the Darkness.\"\n\nSister Faora looked out over her congregation.\n\n\"I'm sure many of you have grown curious as to what Light we could wield somewhere as desolate as this.\" Sister Faora allows herself a smirk and brief chuckle before inclining her head to the two Guardians now seated at the back of the chapel.\"\n\n\"It is here that we will stand against the second eclipse of the Traveler's Light. It is here that the Collapse shall begin anew, should we falter. I do not know when, only what is and will be.\"\n\nThey stared back at her, eyes full of conviction, faces bright with belief, hearts filled with assured direction. Their minds lacked nuance. Vance's chest swelled as he breathed in their stalwart faith coiled around sweetly smelling barks and spices that popped over torchlight.\n\n\"The spires of Mercury shall be filled with the glory of the Traveler. Their Light will shine against the long shadow when Darkness reaches to snuff out the Sun. Mercury will sing when day finds night, and we will direct it. These are Osiris's words, by his own hand. We followed the prophet here to facilitate his preparations for the second coming, whatever they may be.\"\n\nShe marinated in the energy of the chapel.\n\n\"We will learn how the Light here is to defeat the Darkness. This is what he has asked of us. These Lighthouses are our deliverance, and now my brothers and sisters… there is much work to do.\"\n\nThe herd stood in response to their shepherd, Vance among them.","name":"Chapter 3 – The Cult of Personality","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/2baea64b02623417df50cf18f1b97b0c.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3230019581,"index":1333,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3230019578":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Entry 3\n\nMy days since arriving at this sanctuary have been blessed with acceptance and tranquility. Healthy debate regarding the Teacher's words is welcomed and appreciated. We all seek to understand the Light and the necessity for Darkness. Sister Faora has fawned over my interpretation of the texts. She said I could see what others could not. She has opened my mind to the consideration that my condition is a blessing rather than a curse. Time will tell.\n\nEntry 8\n\nOur peace was disrupted today by an assault from the warmongering Cabal at our doorstep. I was ushered to safety at the top of the spire by Leanna, one of our Warlock sisters. Without a moment's notice, she jumped straight into the fray and began to push our intruders back. During the battle, something strange occurred. Leanna was fighting near-insurmountable odds—based on the amount of ammunition I heard discharged—and she was overcome. Of course, she was resurrected by her Ghost, but the spire reacted. There was a hum; the timbre consisted of two distinct resonating tones—one smooth and warm, the other sharp and cold. I thought I could have imagined it through the ringing of gunfire, but it was most certainly there. It was almost imperceptible, and I thought merely a coincidence until it happened again. Eremac, the other Warlock and student of the Dawnblade, was also temporarily disposed of. The roar of the Colossus's slug launcher tearing through Eremac's flesh was unmistakable, but so was the tone that followed. I have to know more. We were able to withstand their incursion, but not without suffering a few casualties. Now we must prepare for a funeral, but my thoughts are dominated by that mysterious tone. Perhaps later, we can try to replicate it.\n\nEntry 12\n\nAfter explaining the phenomenon to Sister Faora, she has recruited the Warlocks to participate in thanatonautic death trials, in the hopes to recreate the hum and gain some clarity into its purpose. During these trials I had others accompany me to the top of the spire to see if they too could hear the tones. None were able to ascertain much—it seems one would need to be musically inclined or have some training—and the weight has fallen on me to decipher the code. I can't be sure of the intent, but I am certain of the cause. Every time one of our Warlocks sacrificed themselves, that same resonance would reverberate through my ears. What does it mean, and what purpose does it serve? Is the spire, in fact, an instrument? I need to expand my research further and see what tones this structure is capable of producing.\n\nEntry 22\n\nThrough countless debates, I have received permission to broaden the scope of my inquisition. We have designs to organize something more formal. Launching under the guise of a tournament or competition, we're leveraging contacts we've made to repurpose some weaponry as bounty. The Guardians are already killing themselves in Shaxx's Crucible. I proposed making our version more exclusive to draw out only the most adept fighters with the strongest connection to the Light. We can make them purchase entry to further fund our studies. They will literally pay for the privilege to kill each other for our \"rewards.\" I've stumbled onto something grand. I will do whatever it takes to get the answers I seek, just as Osiris would. Should he ever return, I imagine he will be quite proud and pleased to meet me.","name":"Chapter 4 - Reflections","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/2baea64b02623417df50cf18f1b97b0c.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3230019578,"index":1334,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3230019579":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"They're so eager to tear each other apart for guns and cloth.\" Brother Vance sighed.\n\nThe early Trials match ran its course. A Hunter, cloaked in light gray and clutching Drang, pressed one hand to a bullet wound in his gut and slumped into cover. He winced as his Ghost spun Light into the wound, slowly weaving flesh together and extracting the bullet. He checked the remaining ammunition in his sidearm. Two hostile Guardians stalked his position in pincer formation and pinned him with suppressing fire.\n\n\"Blood money runs cheap these days,\" Vance continued. He shifted toward the frame next to him. \"Don't you think, Cheska?\"\n\n\"Perhaps the presented motive is flawed.\" Ch3-5ka, a repurposed Redjack and assistant to Vance, had expressed hesitation about their endeavor. It had expressed hesitation about using its uplink to patch into the Crucible monitoring system. It had expressed hesitation about the strangely coded sub-routine running in the Lighthouse spire's architecture. Some level of anxiety, Vance would jab, was intrinsic to Redjack programming.\n\n\"In the Crucible, Lord Shaxx guides new Lights with positivity and—\"\n\nVance nodded for a moment before interrupting. \"Most Guardians care only for power and glory. That is what makes Osiris so unique. Meaning drives us. Understanding. Knowledge. These are the marks of our work's importance.\"\n\nGunshots rang through the arena's capture devices. Ch3-5ka's commentary singled in on the Hunter, last remaining of his fireteam. The Hunter twirled from their cover, propelled by a burst of Light, and flicked a tripmine grenade under the assailant on his left. The explosion killed her instantly, allowing the Hunter to shift and rattle off three rounds, Vance noted, toward his other opponent. One round struck the Guardian's helm and ricocheted off, splitting his visor.\n\n The Hunter squeezed the trigger again, which responded with an ineffectual click. The split-helm Guardian rushed him.\n\nThe sandy Lighthouse alcove they had repurposed as observation room was abuzz with Ch3-5ka's match analysis and an inconspicuous droning.\n\nThe Hunter dropped his sidearm and reached for a slung fusion rifle, but the rushing Guardian struck him solidly with a fist full of lightning. The droning hum shifted somewhat lower.\n\nVance straightened against his chair back at the frame's vibrant description of Guardians spinning deeper into ruthlessness. He could feel a crescendo hanging just moments ahead. He noted the resonant murmur undulating through his skin and into his bones.\n\nDowned and stunned, the Hunter struggled to stand. The split-helm Guardian towered above him, pulled a hand cannon, and slowly discharged. Every. Single. Chamber.\n\nThe hum spiked. \"Fireteam eliminated,\" Ch3-5ka stated blankly, though Vance could barely hear its words.\n\nThe victor stood over the Hunter's bullet-ridden corpse, and the Lighthouse sang to Vance. The Hunter's Ghost compiled into existence over his Guardian's body.\n\n\"Someone needs an attitude adjustment,\" the Ghost sneered.\n\nThe victorious Guardian craned his head toward the Ghost. He raised his hand cannon and sunk trigger to frame. The revolver's cylinder rotated, the hammer fell, and the piece gave off a heavy, empty click.\n\n\"Are you crazy?!\"\n\n\"Brother Vance. I believe a Ghost is in danger. It is against Sanction-C2-1 to harm a Lightbearer's Ghost.\"\n\nVance tuned the frame out, turning his ear instead to various audio playbacks from the match. He listened to distinguish gun caliber, Light affinity, and fireteam movements as the hum's tone changed. He traced them through sound cues and shouted, disembodied announcements. He pinpointed each variable for which he could account and directed Ch3-5ka to capture every analytic scrap.\n\nThe Guardian dropped a round into the cylinder and spun it lazily.\n\n\"Let's find out.\"\n\nThe Hunter's Ghost discharged a pulse of Light, blinding the Guardian and raising the Hunter. The risen Hunter swift-drew a cannon of Light, as if reactively defending his Ghost. He cracked off a single golden shot from his flame-licked weapon. The shot pierced its target and sent ash snaking into the air.\n\nThe Lighthouse played Vance a new song. It hummed, deeper than before. He took in the sensation as low bass rolled through his chest. The hums grew dull, darker, as if born from death. Vance sat straight up, spine rigid, with a wide smile on his face. He composed a harmony of similar tones in his mind, tracking their down-pitch trajectory with anticipation. He thought of Osiris, how his research had led him down less-traveled routes through less-practiced methods. The knowledge that Vance alone could interpret these tones focused his work and narrowed his inhibitions. Purpose persuades.\n\n\"Cheater,\" Ch3-5ka blurted out. \"Match-call misalignment.\"\n\nVance's response ducked the conversation to start his own.\n\n\"I heard the Light bend. The Lighthouse reached out to that Guardian when they died… and their Light reached back. They are harmonious.\"\n\nCh3-5ka picked up his line of thought, adding: \"Anomaly detected. There has been a transmission from the Lighthouse. Uplink time: 0.00019 seconds.\"\n\n\"A random artifact, nothing more. Conclude this match. Archive the recordings. There is much to do.\"\n\n\"Match-call misalignment.\"\n\n\"Of course. We cannot abide cheating. Give the match to the team with the incinerated one.\"\n\n\"If you believe that to be best.\"\n\nVance tilted his head at Ch3-5ka's biting tone. It was sharp, unlike the lathering hum of the Lighthouse, unlike peaceful static from the structure's sub-routine channels. The frame was starting to sound like Leanna. Her doubt.\n\n\"Deliver the prizes to the victors.

As you know, we've been running the Trials for some time now. On Mercury there exists a spire, one of many, that we've called the Lighthouse.

I always make sure to be near, so as not to miss a note.

Many lives were lost today in a barbarous skirmish across the Last City, but none as important as the life lost in our Trial. I believe Guardians have adopted the term \"final death\" for these such instances. A competitor was defeated at the precise moment the Light was stripped from him; his Ghost destroyed in the concussive blast from a pulse grenade. Then, the most marvelous phenomenon occurred: The Lighthouse spoke to me but changed its key. A D-sharp minor, if I'm not mistaken.

Standing in front of the Mercurial vista before him, overwhelmed and listening—the lush marigold sand slopes sweeping over themselves with each breeze, rushing radiolarian fluid cascading down Vex emplacements, the distant pulsing of an unclaimed patrol beacon. His back now to the structure that once inspired him with its song. It mocked him with a deafening silence. How could he have miscalculated this erroneously?\n\nOsiris felt a pang of pity for Vance, but had greater matters to attend to, and left without offering a farewell.\n\n\"That was rough,\" Sagira sneered. \"But he was right. Everything he discovered… the implications…\"\n\n\"I know,\" Osiris admitted remorsefully. \"Which makes this situation all the more precarious.\"\n\n\"Osiris! Wait!\" Brother Vance came vaulting out of the Lighthouse at breakneck pace.\n\n\"Here we go.\"\n\n\"Hush, Sagira.\"\n\n\"Queen Mara Sov… wanted me… to tell you…\" Vance struggled to catch his breath. \"She wanted me to tell you, 'plant the seed.'\"\n\nOsiris studied Vance quizzically.\n\n\"I don't know what she means, but she said you would.\" Vance offered, apologetically.\n\n\"I believe I do,\" Osiris replied, placing his hand on Vance's still-heaving shoulder. \"Thank you. This is quite useful. Well done.\"\n\nWith that, Osiris departed.\n\nVance listened as the Sails of Osiris took off, the pungent smell of burning fuel from its turbine engine clogging his nostrils, and repeated to himself, \"Well done,\" with a slight smile breaking across his lips.","name":"Chapter 8 - Idolatry","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/2baea64b02623417df50cf18f1b97b0c.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3230019574,"index":1338,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3230019575":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The new Lighthouse obscured the silhouette of the sun.

He'd never been here before; as far as he could remember, he'd never been anywhere before. He couldn't remember anything, and all he had to go on was the name given to him by a strange, silver drone. A name he didn't even recognize: Felwinter.\n\nAll around him were giant, gilded shelves, half of them broken, littered with tattered books and cracked cylindrical cases. He stepped on a book and broke its spine as he walked. The little drone followed him.\n\n\"I know you don't trust me,\" it said. \"But you have no choice. Who else have you got?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Felwinter said. He thought for a second. \"I don't know anything.\"\n\n\"Exactly. So you should listen to me.\"\n\nThe soaring height of the ceilings made the building feel like an open space. Remnants of an old fresco loomed over his head, cracked and faded. Maybe it was beautiful once. Felwinter trudged through the empty fog of his memory, trying to understand how he got here.\n\n\"You're stubborn, obviously. But if we stay here long enough, you're gonna die.\"\n\nFelwinter tried to tune out the little drone's voice; he needed to think. He picked his way through the ocean of books, but stopped dead when an explosion rocked the building. He looked up. Dust fell from the faded ceiling in clouds.\n\n\"See,\" the drone said. \"This is what I mean. We have to go. A place like this isn't safe.\"\n\nBeside them, a computer terminal—one that looked broken beyond repair—flickered to life. The building shuddered again. A warbling female voice came on over a PA system, crackling and distant: \"Site-wide lockdown initiated.\" Then, a reassuring male voice, smooth, but made eerie by the warped quality of the recording: \"All library patrons please report to the nearest emergency station. If you require assistance, an attendant can help you at the reception de—\"\n\nThe recording cut off and the building shook again. Metal shutters began to descend over the windows, groaning from age and disuse.\n\nSomething big hit the building, and debris showered down over them.\n\n\"We should hide,\" the drone said, and Felwinter had no choice but to agree. They fled the library.\n\nOutside, crouched in the rubble of another building, they watched together as the library was crushed under a torrent of what looked to Felwinter like falling stars.\n\n\"See,\" the drone said.","name":"1.

Not a meteor at all, Felwinter realized when he looked back, but something metal, man-made. The second hit its target. He died. Six deaths later, crawling out from under metal wreckage, losing pieces of himself, clawing, running, they finally managed to find shelter in a cave. \n\n\"Nrp,\" Felwinter said, as if he were swallowing all of his words and choking on them. \"Rnnn.

He looked at the drone, trying to read its body language. \"Because of you?

Recognition of injustice could not create a just world.\n\nThere were other lessons, too, though those were more tactical: Never rest in the same place twice, and don't rest at all if you can help it. Never cross an open field if a less-exposed route exists. Beware of meteor showers. Look out for organic enemies, but don't waste your time avoiding them. They aren't the real threat.\n\nThat night, Felwinter and the drone sheltered together in the loft of an old barn. A vicious rainstorm outside impaired visibility enough to justify an overnight, but Felwinter couldn't stop himself from thinking, from assessing. Flimsy building. Big empty field. Low attack readiness in this loft. Flimsy building. Big empty field. Low attack readiness…\n\nAnd still, no matter what the drone said—that he didn't need to sleep—he felt an inexplicable exhaustion. He couldn't locate it precisely. It permeated all of him. The drone noticed. It never said anything, but Felwinter knew it noticed.\n\nHe rested his head on his knees. Beside him, the drone hovered at his shoulder, drifting away occasionally to assess the weather through a glassless window.\n\nEventually, Felwinter raised his head.\n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked the drone quietly.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Your name,\" he said. \"You gave me one.

He looked up at the blue sky and opened his arms. \"Good traveling weather. We're lucky.\"\n\nFelwinter and Felspring exchanged a look, then focused on the road ahead again.\n\nGryphon looked at Felwinter, hoisting his pack up on his shoulder. \"Where are you headed, anyway? You never said.\"\n\nFelwinter took a beat too long to say, \"Not sure.\"\n\nThis stumped Gryphon—inexplicably, Felwinter thought. \"Huh,\" he said. \"Just walking?\"\n\n\"You could come with us,\" said Gryphon's Ghost. She wore a green and yellow shell with flower-like petals.\n\n\"No,\" said Felspring. And then, remembering the world of polite conversation, she added, \"We're going somewhere. We just don't know the name.\"\n\nGryphon and his Ghost absorbed that information, nodding. \"An adventure,\" Gryphon said finally with a grin in his voice. \"Right? This whole world is an adventure, isn't it? And we get a thousand chances to live it.\"\n\nFelwinter said nothing. He felt uneasy. He rarely spoke, but when he did, he never sounded like Gryphon did. His voice never sounded like that. He never even had the impulse to talk that way. Why?\n\nThey walked on, passing through a string of abandoned factories. There was evidence of the Fallen everywhere, but it looked old. Ripped-up banners, trampled in the mud. A Walker stripped of most of its parts. Gryphon loosed his gun from its holster, casually, but didn't break his step.\n\nGunfire stuttered out from an open doorway. A bullet clanged off of Felwinter's shoulder like a clapper off a bell. Arming his rifle, he returned fire in the direction the shots had come from.\n\nHe should have known this was a bad spot. Low visibility. A lot of corners. Squat buildings they couldn't see inside of. Hundreds of rusted shipping containers to hide in…\n\nThe doorway was a decoy. Ten, twenty, thirty armed and armored combat frames with glowing red eyes spilled out of warehouses to their left and right. Moving with discipline and eerie synchrony, the frames began a pincer maneuver, trying to pin them down. Gryphon swore.\n\n\"We have to get to cover,\" Felwinter said.\n\nFighting back to back, rezzing each other when they died, Felwinter and Gryphon took down some 15 frames with gunfire alone, and a few more with grenades. Several got back up despite crippling damage, tottering forward on bent and broken legs, relentless, single-minded. They drew inexorably closer as the two Exos ran down their ammunition and energy.\n\nIt was Gryphon who saved them in the end, with three bolts of Arc Light that erupted out of his hands. As the frames closest to them disintegrated in a shower of blue light, Gryphon whooped and said, breathlessly, \"I've never done that before.\"\n\nFelwinter went to examine one of the (mostly) intact frames. \n\nGryphon followed. \"Damn,\" he blurted. \"Do you know what these are?\"\n\n\"No,\" Felwinter said. Not Exos…\n\nFelspring zipped in between them. She scanned the frame, bathing it in blue light. She hesitated, and then offered, \"Rasputin?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Gryphon's Ghost agreed. \"See this logo?\" She indicated a symbol on the frame's chassis that looked a little like a military badge. \"Matches my database.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Gryphon. He looked at Felwinter. \"What did you do to get a Warmind on your case?\"\n\nFelwinter stared down at the frame. \"What's a Warmind?\"","name":"4.

Now that they'd found it, Felwinter realized he didn't know what they were looking for.\n\n\"I don't know very much about Rasputin,\" Felspring said, floating cautiously beside him. \"I thought he was deactivated. Or destroyed in the Collapse.\"\n\nFelwinter walked forward. The room was like a time capsule: untouched, preserved, as if technicians might walk in at any time to work the control panels lining the walls. It reminded him of the library where he'd woken up, just in its complexity and… maybe beauty. Was this beautiful? He wasn't sure.\n\n\"So why would a Warmind be after us?\" Felwinter muttered.\n\nFelspring hovered to examine a flat, black surface on one of the control panels. \"I don't know.\"\n\nFelwinter came up beside her.

It blinked to life under his hand, bright code and controls glowing orange, rearranging themselves as he dragged his finger across them.\n\n\"How did you do that?\" Felspring whispered.\n\nFelwinter shook his head.

They weighed the pros and cons and decided that a fortified home base was safer than picking a new, ramshackle camp every time they wanted to rest. It was risky, but so was everything.\n\nSo Felwinter climbed a mountain. At the top of it was a pre-Golden Age observatory they'd found in a map database in a Seraph bunker. It was the perfect place to hide: it had a 360° view of the surrounding area; existing structures that could be fortified; a mountain they could burrow into to hide themselves beneath thousands of tons of rock…\n\n\"He won't find you up here,\" Felspring said. \"Or… at the very least, you'll see him coming.\" She sounded almost hopeful. \"Maybe we could finally stop running.\"\n\nFelwinter looked warily at the sky and said nothing.\n\nThe only problem with the mountain was that it was occupied: a Warlord named Castor had claimed it and the village at the mountain's base. But Felwinter knew that everyone had a price, and he called on Castor to negotiate.\n\nWarlords, he'd learned, were poor negotiators. They were almost never willing to give ground.\n\nIn the end, Felwinter shot Castor's Ghost and pushed him off the side of the mountain.\n\nA month later, during a routine patrol of the mountain's perimeter, Felwinter found a woman sitting on a rock ledge halfway down the mountain. Beside her, there was a wooden crate of sad-looking crops, and another heavy with ammunition. She stood up when he arrived.\n\nFelwinter exchanged a look with Felspring, then asked the woman, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"My name's Aarthi,\" she said. \"You killed Lord Castor, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So you're the lord of this mountain now.\"\n\n\"It's my mountain,\" Felwinter said. \"But I'm no Warlord.\"\n\nAarthi studied him.

At the same time, Felspring decrypted and searched old command records for signs of SIVA. By now, they moved like clockwork.

Each time, we stored even more food, and we hid it more carefully, in case the raiders returned.\n\n\"And they did. When they saw that we had survived the winter, they fought even harder for our food, and found nearly all that we had hidden. And so it was, for too many years.

Spider suspected treachery. He demanded Crow take to the field and come back with an answer; something Spider could use to encourage loyalty, he said. Something he could mount on his wall.\n\nCrow had tracked the associate to an unexplored corner of the Tangled Shore, but when he finally crested the ridge, he saw exactly what he had expected.\n\nThe trail ended at a cryptolith, which jutted crudely from the dark basalt. The whispers of Xivu Arath had caught another of Spider's toadies—just like the last one, and the pair before that. But as Spider said, he wasn't interested in \"mights and maybes.\" He demanded proof.\n\nCrow knelt in the shadow of the cryptolith, the Lure already in his hands. There were recent Eliksni tracks in the fine blue sands; a dozen or so individuals. Nothing he couldn't handle.\n\nHe pulled a vial of condensed Ether from his belt and slotted it into the Lure. The concoction bubbled as it mixed with the soulfire inside the reservoir. Moisture beaded on the Lure's thin metal casing.\n\nHe drove the mount into a crack in the ground, adjusted the output, and watched as the thick pheromone mist rolled away from the Lure.\n\nHe waved Glint over and the pair headed to a rocky vantage point. He tinkered with the compression on his modified Shotgun, placed it across his lap, and prepared himself for the worst part: listening to the cryptolith broadcast its malignant sermon.\n\nHe felt the presence of the spire itch on his skin. Crow tried not to stare at the grotesque totem as it twisted and hummed, but he felt profoundly uncomfortable when its pulsing light was out of his sight. It was as if he was being hunted.\n\nCrow adjusted his weapon sights again as his silent vigil continued. He felt the stress beginning to wear on him. Waves of throbbing pressure emanated from the tower. His eyes ached. He concentrated on his breathing.\n\nGlint flew to a nearby boulder to scan an interesting patch of lichen and Crow closed his eyes, trying to quell the nausea building inside his head. Hushed whispers surrounded him. He felt as though something reached out and caressed his chest, just above his heart. The scent of perfume, soft and familiar…\n\n\"Crow,\" Glint said.\n\nCrow's eyes snapped open. \"I see them.\"\n\nA group of Eliksni Wrathborn were approaching the Lure. One among them wore the telltale quills of the House of Spider. Their movements were uncoordinated but had the troubling strength granted by subservience to Xivu Arath.\n\n\"They're already gone,\" Crow said bitterly.\n\nThe Wrathborn came upon the cryptolith. They were distraught, ranting. Their fury was rising. They lifted their voices in harsh clicking speech and tore at the ground around the Lure with their otherworldly power.\n\nOne passed Crow's perch, and he could see it: cloudy eyes, slavering jaws, an aura of wrath shimmering around it like a heated haze. It charged toward the rest and its rhythmic howls of rage joined theirs.\n\n\"They're chanting,\" Glint whispered, his curiosity forcing him to peek at the growing horde. \"The syntax is garbled, but I could translate—\"\n\n\"Don't,\" Crow said. \"Please.\"\n\nHe looked down the sights of his weapon and started his work.","name":"Duality","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"The question becomes whether or not to fire, not where to aim.\" —Osiris","hash":3460576091,"index":1368,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"370712896":{"displayProperties":{"description":"[in winding Eliksni script:] This power bestowed by the Dark was given first to the Eliksni—not to the machine-children, who are unlucky second-borns, unstoried and short in their memories.

They didn't seem to notice the signal. At the signal's source, I discovered a small camp of what I initially thought were Scorn. Upon further observation, I found that these were not Scorn but Fallen afflicted with some kind of flesh deformity and mental degradation. Shot one dead and the others just looked at me.

Out in the Reef, ruins are as much landmarks as planets and moons. The flotsam of derelict colony ships from the Golden Age flood the atmosphere along with the ruined hulks of Hive ships from campaigns fought against the Awoken. For the Eliksni, finding the wreckage of a Ketch is like finding the ruins of a family home, and all the emotions that come with it. But the societal scars of Eliksni clans have long since vanished, and for those who bend a knee to the Spider in the remote corner of the Reef known as the Tangled Shore, they have lost the privilege of such sentimentality.\n\nA salvage crew was dispatched the week after a small scouting party from the Spider's personal fiefdom spotted the wreckage of a Ketch belonging to the lost House of Kings. The crew chief on the operation, an ambitious Vandal named Kosis, had shed her attachments to a life within that very house years ago. But the choice to leave something behind and the act of doing so are two entirely different things.\n\nKosis insisted first on surveying the wreck herself, alone, before allowing her team near it. They were to take anything with even a shred of value after unceremoniously cutting the vessel from bow to stern. As they marked it for dissection, she watched them from a nearby escarpment. She looked around and carefully revealed the small bundle of vestiges she personally salvaged from the Ketch: a ceremonial washing bowl, a child's musical instrument, and the cracked ceramic effigy of a Servitor. Kosis covered them with a tattered cloth the color of the setting sun—branded with the symbol of a house she no longer called hers—and buried them.\n\nIt was the only dignity this ship would receive.","name":"I.

The Dregs begrudgingly established guard posts on overlooks surrounding the camp, with nighttime sentry rotations to match, and the crew's scrap-work Shank orbited the site on alarm mode.\n\nSavek seethed as she and the other Dregs dug out their guard posts. These precautions were meant to deter competing parties from biting the crew's claim, but it was a waste of energy this far out. The foreboding quiet would betray any approaching Pikes.\n\nOnce camp was established, each crew member received an Ether ration commensurate with their station. Savek tried not to hunger as she watched Kosis inhale three full portions of the life-giving essence; more than twice her own share. The Spider had given them just two tanks—partly as a cost-saving measure, and partly as an incentive to get the job done quickly.\n\nLater that night, a crewmate woke Savek from her deep slumber. \"You're late. Northwestern posting. Two-cycle shift,\" the Dreg grumbled. Savek clicked her mandibles in irritation and trudged wearily into the deep violet gloaming of the Shore.\n\nSavek was nestled in her dugout at the top of a wide dune, trying not to fall back asleep, when she heard a faint whisper. An urgent, familiar call from the far side of the dune, away from camp. Savek bolted upright. Maybe someone wandered away from camp. Or maybe, she thought subversively, someone secured a portion of Ether and needs an accomplice. The latter possibility sent her scuttling down the dune.\n\nWhen she reached the bottom of the slope, she found herself alone. Yet the beckoning whisper persisted, voluminous as an explosion and gentle as a caress. It came from a rocky cave no larger than Servitor.\n\nSavek drew her rusted Shock Pistol, clicked on her light, and peered into the cave. There, she saw it: the small black tower, poking gently out of the ground, like a babe in swaddling.","name":"II.

Her excited description of her discovery was bold enough to spark Kosis's curiosity. Savek was keenly aware that failure to deliver on such a claim would be punishable by more than the docking of an arm.\n\nThey gathered two Dregs, but by the time the four reached the structure, Savek could see it had changed. Where once only darkness filled the space within its frame, a hint of sickly green light now shone. Tendrils of smoke wafted from the apertures, as though it were an incense brazier.\n\nKosis immediately strode forward and assessed the nodule crowning the surface of the barren rock. As the Vandal knelt beside the structure, she saw deformed latticework-like veins protruding through and eroding the stone, as though the object was grown rather than constructed. Kosis waved the Dregs over.\n\nPressure began to build inside her head, behind her eyes, as the ground rumbled. They sprang back, away from the structure; the artifice sprang to life in turn. It twisted its way out of the ground, spiraling upward and outward, spreading open like a terrible biomechanical flower. Only when the eruption halted did Kosis feel the pressure in her head recede.\n\nIt was undeniably of Hive origin, but Kosis had never seen anything of the sort. This implication, this realization—perhaps this was novel to the Spider as well. If that were true, this piece of \"living\" Hive technology would be worth more than Ether. Perhaps…\n\nKosis gestured to the now towering length of living metal. \"Take it apart.\"","name":"III.

Even disassembled, the Hive tower was intricate. Multi-layered. Woven metal latticework coiled in ever-tightening concentric cylinders. Each could spin independently within the larger housing. Maddeningly complex armatures were contained within, lubricated by gristly, living tissue.\n\nKosis had marked the Hive salvage specifically for the Spider's attention. It wouldn't be shipped off to marketplaces and storehouses like the remains of the Ketch—finds like this were of special interest to him. Kosis considered sending a missive ahead of the shipment but thought better of it. If she weren't there to present the find herself, another ambitious Vandal or Dreg might try and take the credit. Spider would probably promote the usurper strictly out of appreciation for their cunning.\n\nKosis was so focused on ensuring the safety of her salvage that she hadn't noticed Savek and the other Dregs running into camp from the direction of the cave. Kosis stood, Sword in hand, half-expecting a mutiny. But from the fear in Savek's eyes, Kosis quickly realized it was anything but.\n\n\"It returned!\" was all Savek could exclaim. The Dregs confirmed: the dismantled structure had regrown in a matter of hours. Kosis ordered the trio to lead her back to the site, to see it with her own eyes. A part of her yearned to see it again.\n\nMuch to Kosis's disbelief, their assertion was true. The structure stood as tall as ever, emanating its hideous green light. A pang of dread shook Kosis to the core. Her mind flooded with memories of childhood stories about the Whirlwind and the onslaught of the Hive.\n\n\"Leave it,\" she ordered. \"Leave it and do not return.\" It was a command, though one born of fear.\n\nThe tower whispered an unheard counteroffer into her subconscious.\n\n<<Come.>>\n\n<<See.>>","name":"IV.

The delicate assignment required her normally sure-handed touch, but that day, she was distracted and unfocused. In a moment of inattention, she cracked the gyroscope's ceramic housing, reducing its resale value by half.\n\n<<The cutting word is a doorway—the first syllable of hated salvation.>> \n\n\"You've ruined it. That's coming out of your share.\" Kosis was suddenly standing behind her. How long had Savek been staring at the broken gyroscope?\n\n\"Flaws diminish the salvage; half portion of Ether and double guard shift. Another mistake, and we leave you behind.\" Those last words were less literal and more a euphemism mutated over time through Eliksni cultural drift. The Dregs lowered their heads as Kosis strode off in the direction of the Ether tanks, then turned their palms toward Savek in sympathy.\n\n<<Cleanse thyself of your decay, then will the mind be free to understand the value of transgression.>>\n\nSavek remembered dragging her exhausted body to her guard post. She remembered watching the lazy debris of the Reef float by. She remembered speaking with someone in the darkness. Someone reassuring and powerful. Who was it?\n\nShe tore her eyes away from the obelisk and surveyed her body in the thin morning light. Her dry skin flaked. Connective tissue wasted at her joints, and a sickly crust had developed around her mandibles. She was emaciated from lack of sleep and Ether.

Either she had to return with less salvage than anticipated, or she had to stretch the Ether reserves to buy more time. She'd have to reduce her own share. Or reduce the size of her crew. Kosis knew what Spider would choose.\n\nShe began cycling through crew members, deciding which one to cull, when the sudden silence of the moment struck her. No Arc cutters sizzled. No grunts of effort or idle chatter. No clangs of loaded salvage. Just the empty wind and the whir of the rusty Shank making its usual rounds.\n\nA dull pressure built in her thorax as she surveyed the abandoned work site. She searched for any explanation except the one she knew to be true. With the holster unclipped on her Shock Pistol, she set off toward the Hive construct.\n\nThere they were, sitting idly in the dirt, staring into the slowly churning spire. They paid her no mind. She tried to speak, but only dull clicks escaped from her mandibles. When she finally found her voice, it came across as a croak, barely audible above the deafening whisper of the tower. \"You lot. Get back to work.\"\n\nSeveral of them turned and stared at her quizzically. They seemed confused. The smallest Dreg and newest to the crew, stood up. He approached her calmly, his voice the howl of the Whirlwind. \"Those born only to live cannot see eternity, nor are they welcome here. If you dwell on that which is beyond your grasp you—\"\n\nThe peal of the Vandal's Shock Pistol tore through the air, rupturing the crew's trance. Several leapt up while other scrabbled away in disorientation. They stared as the young Dreg slumped to the ground, his face disfigured by a blistering hole. The whispering had ceased.\n\nIn the silence that followed, Kosis found the rest of her voice. \"I just extended our Ether rations by three days.\" She backed away, her Pistol held level. \"Hurry up.

From the escarpment overlooking the salvage site, the Ketch looked like the disemboweled remains of some great beast.\n\nKosis wondered, as she sipped on a hand-tank of Ether, if this is what her people had become. Carrion birds to the rotting carcasses of their society. She wondered how many more generations of Eliksni it would take before the old ways were entirely forgotten. If any Eliksni born today would know how to play the instrument now buried on the overlook.\n\nWould her daughters be proud of how she had chosen to survive? She wondered where their bones were scattered. Wondered if they suffered when the House of Kings was torn apart.\n\nThe sound of footsteps pulled Kosis from her thoughts.

I'm from Mars. But right now, me and my Dad are on our way to join my Papa at a brand-new colony on Europa! Papa is the lead quantum engineer at BrayTech, which basically means he builds super-cool computers. He's so good at it, he gets to work with the Clovis Bray on all the top-secret stuff. He even designed some of Rasputin's hardware! \n\nI hope he shows me what he's working on. He used to do that, back on Mars. \"It'll be a good learning opportunity for you,\" he'd say, \"But only if you promise not to tell anyone.\" And I never have. Even though my friends back home bugged me about Papa's work all the time. \n\nMy old home, I mean. Soon Europa will be my home, and you'll be my new next-door neighbor over on Io! I wish we could pass by you on the way so I could see you up close, but Eventide (that's the colony) needs supplies and Dad is supposed to start working right away. \n\nHe's a psychologist. I don't really get what he'd even do for BrayTech. All he does is ask people how they're feeling over and over again. Maybe they need him to train a Warmind like Dr. Ana Bray did. Only instead of language, he'll teach it how to analyze its dreams. \n\nDad always teases Papa that a human brain is a lot harder to work with than a hard drive. Maybe Papa got him on one of his projects to finally prove him wrong. \n\nWhat do you have: a hard drive or a brain? Are you an AI like Rasputin? Have you ever talked to him?\n\nSorry if these questions are nosy. Dad says I'm super curious and that's okay, I just need to learn when to stop asking questions.

Did you know that at night, it can get as cold as 140 Kelvin? \n\nI wonder why Clovis Bray chose to build Eventide here, when you're over there terraforming Io? Even if you're not finished, it's probably way nicer…\n\nStill, I'm glad we're here. Seeing Papa again made me so happy I almost cried. (I didn't though.) Once, on the way here, I forgot what his face looked like. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't see it in my mind. It was awful. \n\nHe's grown a beard, so he looks different now. I like it, but Dad said he feels like he's kissing a polar bear. Papa said Dad'll grow a beard too once he discovers how much warmer his face will be. \"Soon you'll have two polar bears for parents, Micah!\"\n\nFor now, I've got a penguin. A plushie, not a real one. I'm too old for plushies, but Papa told me it's from Clovis Bray. \"A souvenir for your soon-to-be arctic adventures!\" Plus it came with this mini version of an ion-shield snowsuit, like the one I have to wear. \n\nIt actually looks pretty cool, so I think I'm going to keep it. \n\nDo you know about polar bears and penguins? Back before you came, they lived on Earth's two poles that had climates a lot like Europa's.

They did it, Clovis Bray and Papa and all the BrayTech scientists made real walking, talking, human-shaped AIs! \n\nI even got to see one when Papa was giving us a tour of the colony! It looked so cool and shiny. It even had these awesome glow-lights for eyes! I wanted to talk to it, but Dad said I couldn't be trusted not to ask too many questions, so he went over on his own. Papa told me that's why Dad is here: to talk to the Exos and analyze their \"human-ness.\" \n\nHe also said he thinks I can be trusted, especially when it comes to keeping my excitement to myself. Some people are scared of the Exos. Which I don't get. How can anyone be anything but amazed by them? \n\nPapa laughed when I asked him that. \"You're like me.

There's only 50 of us kids, so they shoved us all in one room with two teachers, which is how I found out that everyone got a penguin plushie. I feel dumb thinking I was the only one, but also, it's kinda dumb of Clovis Bray to assume babies and big kids would want the same toy. Some of the older kids threw theirs in the recycling chute, but I managed to rescue one. I think I'll call this one Calumet. That's the aeronaut you didn't get to meet because she died on the way to Mars. \n\nThat's the one thing that scares me. Not the Exos or anything else I don't understand.

But of course, when we got outside, everyone went running in a bunch of directions. That's when I decided I'd learn more useful stuff over at the Exo factory with Papa and Dad. I didn't break the rules. The factory was in sight, plus I had two buddies: Mihaylova and Calumet. \n\nI knew I couldn't go in the front door without a badge. So I went around the side to the loading bay where there were two Exos unloading a bunch of crates. They looked like they were almost done, so I hid under the dock to wait for them to leave.\n\nInstead, I heard one of them sit down. \"I'm taking a break. Need to or not, this is when we used to have lunch. I refuse to work through lunch.\"\n\nAnd the other one said, \"I miss lunch.

You tell him about the whisper?\"\n\nThat's when I wanted to leave. I didn't like them making fun of Dad. Plus, the way they talked about food and dreams… it made me feel sick.

But all I have are these words stuck in my head. \n\nAre you sure you know what you think you know?\n\nThis morning, Papa told me Dad's been sleeping at the factory because he's so busy, but soon he'll get a break. \"And then we'll spend the whole day together as a family.\" \n\nI'm not sure, but I think he's lying. \n\nTomorrow, the supply ship leaves for Mars and I want to go. So I've packed my bag and once Papa goes to sleep, I'm going to put on my snowsuit and go out to find Dad. I don't care if I run into a whole army of Exos. \n\nMaybe I'll take Mihaylova out of my bag and carry her. For extra support. That's probably dumb, but… \n\nI don't really know what else to do.\n\nGoodbye, \n\nMicah","name":"LETTER 9","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/be41a72fde112e6caf299fddf647b377.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1251508587,"index":1419,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"4028955452":{"displayProperties":{"description":"JUNE3/10:43AM\n\nThe walls are shaking again.

Stop worrying, and activate the new model,\" he says.\n\nHe's breaking protocol again. Every Exo and human in this room can see it. \"Dr. Bray explicitly stated we were to wait for her return—\"\n\n\"I am the only Dr. Bray you take orders from now. We have to assume Elisabeth is dead.\"\n\nThe talking robot head is just as cold as the old man was. What else would you expect from the psycho who died and made himself into an all-seeing AI? Here's to hoping the unconscious Exo in front of us is nothing like the real thing.\n\n\"Now activate him immediately, or I will promptly deactivate you.\"\n\nOkay, okay. I trigger the Awakening Protocol. The Exo's eyes light up. It's confused. I remember that feeling. Who am I? Where am I? Where'd my skin go? At least we woke up with protocols in place. This guy's entering a war zone. Can't be pleasant.\n\n\"Who am I? Where am I? Am I… metal?\" the new guy asks. Called it. The AI takes the lead.\n\n\"The answers to those questions are rather complicated, and our usual methods of easing you into this reality are not currently at our disposal. So I will attempt simplicity in my responses.\"\n\nThe AI goes on to quickly explain where we are, what Exos are, how they work, and why they're important.\n\n\"…And once you've completed your training, there will be a shiny new toy waiting for you to commemorate your accomplishment. Why? Because you're special. Unstoppable. A fighter and an intellectual—better than the rest. Nothing in the whole universe will be able to stop you,\" the AI finishes.\n\n\"I see. That sounds… good. And who… what are you?\" the new guy asks.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked. I'm Clovis Bray. And you and I are—\"\n\n\"Why is he awake?\" a voice demands.\n\nDr. Bray—she's alive! Came in through the tunnel. This should be good.\n\nA couple Exos trail behind her: Noe-2 and Mia-9.\n\n\"I thought you'd died, Elisabeth,\" says the AI, \"So I asked Wen-1 here to wake him up.\" Dr. Bray flashes me an angry look. I ought to unplug the AI bastard.\n\n\"So you broke protocol,\" she says.\n\n\"I put the protocol in place, Elisabeth. I can break it. I only need someone I trust to initiate the signal.\"\n\nI can sense Dr. Bray's frustration. \"The Vex are everywhere. We should be evacuating Europa. There's a group of survivors pinned down in Bunker E15. I need help rescuing them.\"\n\n\"That can wait. I've equipped Charon's Crossing with an advanced signaling technology connected to the Warmind and his bunkers. If we match that to the communication signal used by the Vex, we could theoretically lead them off-world and salvage what we've built here. But the Vex have cut off internal communications channels and Cloud Memory Collection. You'll need to do it manually, Elisabeth,\" the AI says.\n\n\"That'll lead the Vex straight to Mars. Earth. You've said it yourself: the Vex desire only annihilation. You're talking about billions of lives lost. I'll play no part in that,\" she says.\n\n\"My sweet naive granddaughter. Humanity never stood a chance against the Vex, and those lives are expendable. Besides, each one lost is an Exo gained. Another soldier to fight against the Vex. The future is Exo. It's Bray. Our legacy—that's all that matters,\" the AI replies. The new guy's listening in. He may be a bit of a blank slate, but he's not digging any of this.\n\nDr. Bray's jaw is clenched something fierce. Looks like she's gonna attack. I don't blame her.\n\n\"Perhaps our legacy should be burnt to the ground,\" she says.\n\n\"Elisabeth… are you planning to activate the Morning Star?\"\n\n\"Once I get everyone I can off-world, I'll do whatever I have to. We won't lose any more lives over this.\"\n\nHell yeah, lady.\n\n\"Everybody, listen up. Exos and able-bodied humans—I need you. Grab any weapons you can, and let's go,\" she says. We're all in. Weapons in hand, we start piling into the tunnel. Even the new guy, but Dr. Bray's not about it.\n\n\"Hold on there. You haven't gone through any initiation protocols. You're not ready,\" she says.\n\n\"If there are lives to be saved, that's where I need to be,\" the new guy replies. He's oddly determined.\n\n\"Where you need to be,\" the AI interjects, \"is with your family. Me.\"\n\n\"Every instinct I have is telling me to reject you,\" the Exo retorts. Nice, new guy.\n\nI bet if Dr. Bray could smile, she'd be doing it right now. She grabs a gun out of a cache and tosses it to the new guy. \"Perhaps you're ready after all,\" she says. New guy stands steady. Handles the weapon well. He's definitely ready for this; protocols be damned.\n\n\"Elisabeth,\" the AI says. He wants the last word. As usual. \"I will protect our legacy.\"\n\n\"That makes two of us,\" she says and closes the tunnel door behind us.\n\nBadass.","name":"RECOVERED MEMORY; WEN-1","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/5d16bac88d2e1a1e16ad83baec99692a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":4028955452,"index":1420,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"4028955455":{"displayProperties":{"description":"MAY19/5:00AM\n\nAnother day, another Forage into 2082 Volantis.

Leaders guided by hope.\n\nWe fall. We rise.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\nWe fight alongside them. Those of us who can make our way across Europa and into the Glassway where the portal resides. We fall. We rise.\n\n11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.\n\nOver and over, we fight. We fall. We rise. Rinse and repeat.\n\n21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.\n\nEvery time, we get a little bit closer. Every time, more and more Vex bodies pile up. It infuriates them.\n\nThey flow faster, they fight harder, the numbers increase. They know now what we're after. They throw everything at us.\n\nBut Clovis-30 and Dr. Bray are unrelenting—Sword slicing effortlessly, stroke after stroke. Rifle blaring like thunder, bullet after bullet. We fall. We rise.\n\n31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.\n\nThe constant reboots aren't without sacrifice. A number of memory banks begin to fry from rapid overuse. A few of us are never coming back. We know this. We rise.\n\n41, 42, 43.\n\nWe finally make it to the inner chamber of the Glassway, where the portal resides. It's barely visible, blocked by the horde of Vex that defend and pour from it.\n\nIn the midst of it all is a giant Vex, the one Dr. Bray told us about. A floating doomsday Vex with the wraparound shield that resembles a Hydra.\n\nThere is no fear in their faces. In the midst of all this, the two Brays stand strong.\n\nThey rally the few of us that remain. Lead us towards a task far beyond daunting. One that should by all rights be impossible.\n\nBut they show us the truth. That with enough courage and compassion, anything's possible. Together, they're the lament that carries the voices of every soul lost to these mindless machines.\n\nWith Clovis-43's final strike, the blade shatters into pieces. He doesn't care—the deed is done.\n\nAs the final piece of that monstrous Hydra hits the ground, we burst into cheers. The very few of us that remain. Dr. Bray lets me do the honors. After all, I was there when this all started.\n\nThe command runs. The portal shuts off. We did it.\n\n\"And now, we destroy it,\" Clovis-43 says. He wants it gone for good.\n\n\"No,\" Dr. Bray says. What? I thought she would agree.\n\n\"You know what this did. It has to go.\"\n\n\"Clovis. You, me, and every other Exo… we deserve the life we were promised. If this portal falls, and we die, we lose that life. And if we're gone, and the Vex find some other way back, humanity is doomed. So, let's shut it down. Hell, let's swallow the damn key. But the portal stays.\"\n\nClovis-43 sighs. \"I hope I don't live to regret this.\"\n\n \"Same goes,\" she says sincerely.","name":"RECOVERED MEMORY; NOE-2","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/5d16bac88d2e1a1e16ad83baec99692a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":4028955444,"index":1428,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1178042180":{"displayProperties":{"description":"JUNE13/3:46PM\n\n\"So it's come to this,\" I say, trying to be cheeky.\n\n\"Come to what?\" Elsie asks.\n\n\"I didn't bring you back to Exoscience just to take a stroll through a snowstorm,\" I say.\n\nShe laughs. \"No, I didn't think you did.\"\n\n\"I have a gift for you.

We both know it.\n\nI place a tablet in front of her.\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\n\"It's his journal. Yours if you want it. Lock it away if you don't. It's mostly encrypted, anyway. I read a bit.

She pulls me in for the first hug I've ever had. Holds me tight. We share the moment. A reverie of what could have been.

Someone's near.\n\nBefore I have the chance to move, they're at the head of my cot.\n\nI swing off of the taut fabric, grab my weapon from the floor, and then roll across the room, blasting Stasis at my assailant. They dodge it entirely, leaving my bed momentarily frozen in time. I fire off rounds, grazing their shoulder. \n\n\"Elsie! Wait!\"\n\nNo one calls me that. Except her.\n\nThe attacker removes her hood. She's changed; a bit worse for wear, but it's her. My stubborn sister.\n\n\"What were you thinking, Ana?!

You really understand how to control it. You're not corrupted… like them.\" \n\nShe sounds desperate. That's a bad sign.\n\n\"We've been over this. My answer remains no,\" I say. Ana is smart but too easily lead astray. It's a miracle she ended up how she did. I can't get involved.\n\n\"Every day, I make it by the skin of my teeth.

I'll find someone else to help me learn Stasis, so I can take down Savathûn.\"\n\nAre things really so bad for her that she has this death wish?\n\n\"You know what she did, Ana. Stasis won't save you. This is a suicide mission.\"\n\n\"There are others out there who are tired of living in fear too. We can find them.\"\n\n\"Good. Go talk to them instead.\"\n\n\"Listen to me. We can attack with the Light and Darkness. Together.\"\n\n\"Or we can keep our heads low and move on.\"\n\n\"There's nowhere else to go! You want to run away—that's your choice.

I guess he didn't vanish with Mars. There is power there, but this is still a foolish plan. Although Ana seems hell-bent on learning Stasis and, with Rasputin, she'll do it. Once she puts her mind to something, there's no stopping her.\n\nI always thought the best way to protect her was to stay away from her. If I push her away now, can I really say I'm doing it for her?\n\n\"Only trouble is, he's stuck on this drive…\" she says knowingly. \"He could use a new vessel.\"\n\nAna smiles at me coyly. She knows exactly what to do and just how to bait me.

We don't know what's in there,\" I say to Ana, standing in front of the entrance to the Deep Stone Crypt.\n\nWe make our way through the war-torn lab. Eramis's siege before the Bombardment sure left its mark on the place. She found Darkness here and helped spread it like a plague on the world. Clovis almost did the same in his time.\n\n\"If I remember right, we have a long drop ahead of us. You better hang on to me,\" I say.\n\nShe wraps her arms over my shoulders, and it's the first time I've been close to a person in over 100 years. I can smell a trace of sodium tallowate. But only a trace. She hasn't bathed for a few days. She squeezes tight. I forgot what this felt like. My body produces a fleeting sensation of warmth. \n\nI move down the elevator shaft. We land as quietly as possible, remaining still. It's dead down here, but the power is on. Someone must have been here… or still is.\n\nAs we make our way through the eviscerated research center, I notice Ana taking it all in. She seems almost familiar with the space. \n\n\"Clovis was an animal, sure. But what he discovered and built is absolutely incredible,\" she breathes. \n\nNever heard her speak so highly of the old man. She forgets that I was there. Doesn't realize the hand he played in our future, even centuries ago.\n\n\"This way!\" she calls out, running ahead. After walking through several corridors, we come to a familiar dead end. It's still there. Clarity Control. I dreaded seeing this again. Practically a standing testament to all the bad that Clovis did. \n\nI want to get away from it, but Ana's fixated. \"Hey, you ready? We need to keep going,\" I say. \n\nShe snaps back to reality. \"Sorry.\"\n\nFinally, we find it. The place where Exos were born. Ana covers her nose as we're greeted with a rotten smell. Slowly, we turn the corner and see a decomposing corpse desperately clinging to a lever on a console. \"The Drifter…,\" Ana says. Hard to tell how long he's been here. We pry his hand from the console and carry him out of the room to try and purge the stench. \n\n\"What do you think he was doing here?\" I ask.\n\n\"Most likely the same thing we are,\" Ana says, plugging in her drive. \"But he failed. Probably for the best. He doesn't deserve another chance.\"\n\nIt's depressing, seeing him like that. All alone down here…\n\nAna works the console. \"Uploading now. Should be out of here soon. Grab that lever.\" \n\nI pull down, and a latch opens, releasing radiolarian fluid into an empty pool nearby. I catch Ana staring at the spot where we found the Drifter's body.\n\n\"You ever think about what we could have done differently?\" she poses.\n\nAll the time. \n\n\"Not really,\" I answer.\n\n\"So much of this death and destruction stems back to us, to our family. I know Clovis was responsible for a lot. He had a hand in bringing the Darkness to this world.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" I ask.\n\n\"I found a journal the last time I was here. It's old, and half the pages were torn out, but it had a lot of information about him that was salvageable.\"\n\nOf course, she's been here before. Clearly, she's not telling me the whole truth.\n\n\"What else was in it?\" I ask.\n\n\"Outside of the redacted memos and experiments, there were stories and recollections of our family. It's all from his perspective, so he was never the villain. But still, maybe he wasn't as bad as we thought. He seemed to care about us, in his way.\" \n\n\"Really?\" \n\n\"He did some good, Elsie.\" \n\n\"I was there, Ana. I saw the things he did. He was delusional. Of course, he was never the villain in his own story.\"\n\nWe sit for a while and wait in silence. \n\nThe pool begins to bubble. Ana jumps to her feet as a sleek metal hand emerges from the fluid. Slowly, the Exo rises. Silky liquid drips from the tendrils that conjoin the parts. Eventually, it takes its first steps out of the pool. \n\n\"Red?\" Ana asks timidly. \n\nIts head turns. Glowing eyes of scarlet meet ours, and it speaks… Russian. \n\n\"Welcome back, old friend,\" Ana says. \n\nWe're in business.","name":"Chapter 2: Itinerant Mendicant","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ac05c474541917635ca7bc1ebc995ff8.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":582234696,"index":1431,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"582234697":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I keep thinking about the Drifter in the basement of the Deep Stone Crypt and wondering when that will be me.

Difficult to think about that day. The Bombardment. We were hit on all sides. Eramis, the Cabal, Savathûn, all attacking our strongholds at once. We never recovered. When the Dark Guardians turned on Eramis and the Cabal, everyone who wasn't killed went into hiding. \n\nRasputin says something in Russian that I miss, and Ana laughs.

Before us stands the once proud Commander of the Vanguard, disheveled, in rags. His ghastly white beard is as thick as a steel door. And from the looks of him, a gentle breeze would knock him off his crutch and one remaining leg. They must have taken his Ghost too. Sad to see the deterioration of a body that's been stripped of its Light.\n\n\"Commander!

Countless people died while you sat on the sidelines and watched everything fall apart.\"\n\n\"If you only knew, Ana. The Darkness…\"\n\n\"Always an excuse. You want to do your part? Then step up and actually help me with this.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to. What is this really about, Ana?\"\n\n\"You just don't get it.\"\n\nShe storms out, leaving a fuming wake behind. I catch a glimpse of Zavala in the corridor. He was listening.\n\n\"You're using Stasis?\" Zavala asks condescendingly.\n\n\"I get to hear it from you now, too?\"\n\n\"Okay, okay. When there was a Vanguard, I thought I had all the answers. Perhaps that was our undoing. I know now that commanding has as much to do with giving orders as it does listening to others' needs. Don't be like I was—angry and trying to control everything. Listen to your sister. Consider why she's asking this of you.\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"We're here! Approaching now!\" Ana calls out, her voice echoing down the corridor.\n\n\"Hoped I'd never see this thing again as long as I lived,\" Zavala says as we come face-to-face with the Leviathan.","name":"Chapter 6: A Matter of Trust","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ac05c474541917635ca7bc1ebc995ff8.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":582234700,"index":1435,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"582234701":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"Commander Zavala, it is good to see you.

I am glad to have found you,\" he says.\n\n\"We are in need of all the allies we can find. And you bring the Bray sisters, I see.\"\n\nI bow. \"It's good to see you again, my Queen.\" I learned in my time with her, before everything collapsed, that the Queen is particular about her customs.\n\nMara smiles back at me. \"And you, my friend.\"\n\n\"Where is Calus?\" Zavala asks.\n\n\"We are unsure of his whereabouts. A problem for another day.\"\n\nShe's surrounded by Cabal and Fallen working alongside what's left of the Awoken army. I had heard some defected to Eris after Mara's failed assaults. Everyone has lost so much to the Dark armies. \n\n\"I'm surprised you don't have Vex here as well,\" Ana says discourteously.\n\n\"An attempt at humor, my Queen,\" I say, nudging Ana in the hopes of conveying to her that the Queen expects respect. \n\n\"The Vex are trapped in time by our betrayer and her Dark army,\" Mara says.\n\n\"We have something that we believe can turn the tide,\" Zavala says, gesturing toward Rasputin. \"The Warmind can locate the Traveler using Clovis Bray's tracking algorithm. We know how to capture the Traveler once we find it, but we'll need your army to build the harness.\" \n\n\"I have slowly been gathering forces in preparation of striking back at Eris and the Witch Queen. I would invite you to join our ranks and swear allegiance, but I can smell the aroma of Darkness around you,\" Mara says, her gaze resting on me.\n\n\"My Queen,\" I say, lowering my head, \"I am wielding Stasis, but we want the same end: to survive this.\" \n\nShe's unconvinced. \n\n\"Elisabeth, you once asked me to pick a side, even if it was the wrong one. Tell me, did you choose correctly?\" she asks.\n\n\"I should hope so, since I am at your side once more.\"\n\nMara and Zavala exchange a loaded glance and he nods, offering his approval.\n\n\"Do not mistake my hospitality for trust. You will earn it on the battlefield.\"\n\nI bow again. Ana does not.\n\n\nLater, as I approach the Queen's quarters, I overhear Zavala. \"…have to be aware, I do not fully trust her. I think she has a thirst for Darkness.\" \n\n\"We will do our best to keep a close eye on that one,\" Mara responds.\n\nHow could they still not trust me?\n\n\"If things go south, I'll do it myself. Ana is my friend, after all,\" he replies.\n\nOh. \n\n\"What are they saying?\" Ana whispers, startling me.\n\n\"Nothing. Let's go,\" I say quietly.\n\n\"Is there a spy in our midst?\" Mara calls out. Not quiet enough, I guess.\n\n\"No, ma'am. We were just coming in to talk strategy,\" Ana says as we enter the room. Quick thinking! \"The Leviathan presents some interesting possibilities.\"\n\n\"My forces are constructing the harness as we speak. No matter what advantages you believe we have, we are still underprepared for the threat we face. Eris Morn is powerful in ways even I do not comprehend. She is using the Darkness to its full potential.\"\n\n\"What if we're able to do the same… but with the Light?\" I propose.\n\n\n\nThrough the unending expanse of space, we see a soft light, a beacon. The Traveler.\n\n\"There you are,\" Zavala says to himself as Mara and her makeshift army ready themselves.\n\nAs we approach, I am awestruck. I forgot how massive it is. We have one shot at this.\n\n\"Red says he's able to access some of the ship's higher functions and weaponry. Dormant satellite arrays as well. Could prove useful,\" Ana says.\n\n\"Some good news, finally,\" Zavala exhales. \"Elisabeth…\"\n\nSuddenly, Zavala collapses to the floor, grabbing his head and screaming loud enough to echo through the Leviathan.\n\n\"What happened?\" Mara demands.\n\n\"I don't know! He just fell,\" Ana responds.\n\nHis eyes open wide. He calms. Then he speaks.\n\n\"We need you. Return to us.\"  \n\nIs he? He's speaking… to the Traveler?\n\n\"You chose us before. Please, give us another chance.\"\n\nHe closes his eyes and rubs his head.\n\n\"It intends to run,\" Zavala says, standing and regaining his composure.\n\n\"What are we gonna do?\" Ana asks.\n\nZavala releases a deep, focused breath. \"Take it back. By force.\"\n\n\"Launch the harness!\" Mara Sov commands as her crew gets to work.\n\nIt fires as the Traveler becomes aware, burning with a rich, luminous glow. Too bright to keep staring. I shield my eyes hoping we built this right. \n\nThe Leviathan shakes, and I grab onto the wall to keep from falling. \n\nThe light fades, and my eyes adjust. Sure enough, the harness has latched onto the sphere like a barnacle, the six arms gripped tight. The Leviathan erupts in applause. I look for Ana, but I can't find her in the mass of bodies.\n\n\"We're coming home, Ikora,\" Zavala says pridefully.","name":"Chapter 7: Commandeered","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ac05c474541917635ca7bc1ebc995ff8.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":582234701,"index":1436,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"582234690":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"I heard you the other day,\" I say, barging into Zavala's quarters.

It's not my place to rouse the crowd, so I stand next to Ana and watch as we approach the Moon, the Traveler locked in tow within the harness.\n\n\"Everyone knows their part. I would like to say that I will see you all again on the other side, but we know that isn't true. That's not why we are here. We are here to stop Eris Morn, at all costs,\" Zavala says. \n\nHe and Mara exchange a glance and a nod. He walks past us without another word, past the Cabal and Fallen. Guess he doesn't like goodbyes, either.\n\n\"We have arrived. Ready yourselves,\" the Queen orders. \"Make no mistake: Eris will die this day.\"\n \nWe rush into the drop ships, leaving Rasputin to pilot the Leviathan. I join Ana and Mara on our journey to the surface. \n\n\"Ana… for all those years, I did what I had to do. But I am sorry it was at the expense of us,\" I say. \n\n\"Save it for after. We're gonna win.\"\n\nThe drop ship hits the ground with a thud, sending tremors through me. The door opens, and we're greeted with a frontal assault of Thrall. We come out firing. It's chaotic, but through the turmoil, I spot the Scarlett Keep. I see Eris Morn, drawing power from beneath the surface, and I see an army of Dark Guardians stampeding toward us.\n\nI look up to the Leviathan and the Traveler, aglow in a phosphorescent haze. He's doing it. Zavala is overcharging himself with Light, siphoning from the Traveler using Ghaul's plans and tech. Good luck, Commander, and thank you.\n\nAna and Mara fight through the Hive mercilessly as the Dark Guardians approach. I find Ana and signal toward Eris. In lockstep, we carry out our assault. Ana opens fire on a Hunter while I cover her, blasting a flanking Ogre with Stasis. Ana drops a grenade under its massive feet, and a second later, it's dust. Eris spots us, and I swear she's smiling. From behind the Keep, a full brigade of the Awoken armada rises, perverted with Hive thorns and insignia. \n\nNow's the time, Warmind. \n\nAs the Awoken defectors fire onto the battlefield, they're blasted out of the sky by satellite arrays in a dazzling display. I can feel Eris's frustration at this. Then I see her, shrouded in Darkness, performing a summoning ritual. \n\nA singular beam of blinding Light tears through the black sky with the velocity of a shooting star, headed straight for the Scarlett Keep. \n\nGive 'em hell, Commander. \n\nHe collides with the structure so precisely that he only creates a small fissure. After a moment, an explosion, bright and disastrous, completely levels the Keep to rubble. We hear a deafening scream throughout the field that could only be Savathûn. Mara races to us. \"The Witch is weakened. We strike now!\" \n\nEris is regaining her footing as we close in. \"All of my detractors in one place. Thank you for bringing them to me, Ana,\" she says and smiles. \n\nI turn to Ana, confused. She pulls out a knife and readies it toward Mara. I make a move to stop her, but I can't. I'm frozen in place… by Ana. She stabs Mara Sov in front of us. \"You're welcome, my Queen.\" Stasis and blood drip from her hands. \n\n\"We are all Dark, eventually,\" Eris says with glee.","name":"Chapter 8: Migration","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ac05c474541917635ca7bc1ebc995ff8.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":582234690,"index":1437,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"582234691":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"What have you done?!\" I scream as Mara Sov's body drops lifelessly to the ground.\n\n\"Elsie, listen to me.

Don't you want to be a family again?\"\n\nNot like this. Not through death and betrayal. Zavala was right about her… I remember the promise I made. \n\n\"I forgive you for all the years you kept me in the dark. I know you were trying to protect me. Forget the past. We can start over. Let me protect you now,\" she says with such sincerity that I know she's too far gone to reason with.\n\nThe look on Ana's face tells me she knows where I've landed. She's genuinely hurt, gritting her teeth to stop herself from crying. I try to raise my hand to blast her, but she's already on the move.\n\nAna attacks and stabs me in my side, disconnecting core components. My left arm goes limp. I look up to see Eris summoning a portal. The Vex come flooding through. Our army of Cabal and Fallen are being eviscerated. Vex Hydras swarm the Leviathan and open fire. If I could cry, I would. We lost. Again.\n\nSuddenly, Eris stands above me with a twisted grin. \"Do you see what the path of the self-righteous yields? You call it protection, but all Ana felt was abandonment. You left a void. Darkness filled it.\"\n\n\"You have bigger problems,\" I say, looking to the sky.\n\nA piercing noise emanates from the Traveler. Its brilliance begins to swell. Worried and confused, Eris commands all her forces to focus on killing it with Dark energy.\n\n\"It didn't have to be this way,\" Ana cries as she drives the knife into me once more. \"You could have been with me!\"\n\nI finally shatter my own binding, blasting her with Stasis. She flies back, locked in the air. I see her struggling. \"Ana, she's corrupted you!\" \n\n\"No… She gave me purpose!\" \n\nDamn it all. I know what I have to do. \n\nI kiss her forehead as I turn her blade and thrust it into her. Her eyes go wide, and some semblance of my sister returns before she fades. \n\n\"Elsie…\" she trails off into the void. My own sister… Eris will pay for this. \n\nThe Darkness energy Eris manipulates canvases the landscape and makes its way to the sky. I see the Traveler, getting brighter as the Darkness encapsulates it. I race toward Eris, but I'm too late. \n\nIn an enchanting explosion, the Traveler's Light enshrouds all in totality. \n\nThen darkness. n\nI'm awake. \n\nI see a tower. THE Tower.\n\nI'm in the Last City. It's… thriving. Bustling with life. Children laughing.\n\nThere's a small parade. I fight through the crowd to find Cayde-6 at the center of it. \"I think I finally got him this time!\" he shouts as a beardless Zavala greets him. \n\n\"Taniks has been dead before,\" Zavala says. \n\nFrom behind him emerges Ikora Rey, like a vision. \"Let the new Hunter Vanguard bask. He's earned it.\"\n\nI'm so sick of this scene. Of hearing these words ever since the day I killed my sister. That was the first time. Now I've lost count. \n\nNo matter what I do, it always ends the same. Blood and betrayal. Then I'm back where I started. Right here.\n\nI'm being taunted, punished.

You have always remained an ally, without my asking. \n\nI am now asking. The Darkness's arrival ushers in a new age and, with it, the revelation of Stasis. We must seize this opportunity before it is too late. This Collapse now escalates—our enemies' agendas advance, and we are losing. \n\nThe Vanguard has played its part in bringing us to this stage, but Zavala is stalwart and far too stringent in his ways.

I have dug in, carved new paths, and found sinew reserves in myself long thought depleted. \n\nWe can win, Ikora. If we wield this tool correctly. We can prevent being overcome from attacks on all fronts. We can rid the world of Savathûn and the blight of the Hive. Consider that. Nothing will dare stand against us when we command the Dark and Light. You believed in Osiris's teachings of balance once. Do not tell me you falter now. I know you are wavering.

Oryx would never have led the Taken without its guidance. Eramis's army has been a vile, deadly force due to its influence. We should learn from their examples. It will subjugate us all if we allow it, so we must spread our message of balance through the Dark. We must show our control—or we too will be lost in the shadow it casts. Now is the time to rise up and take command. Use its power to eliminate the puppets in its grasp.

Be their lodestar for hope.\n\nThat is our path to eradicating those who misuse the Darkness.

This communication shall go undelivered, along with others that never found their destination. \n\nI feel guilt. Pain. Anger. I am sorry I was not there for you at your final hours. What you must have felt, knowing you were facing the certain end… I hope the majesty of Io and the sacred land of the Cradle provided some comfort where I could not.\n\nYour affliction was ravaging you—this is known. After all your suffering, perhaps you welcomed death. In a way, I envy you. To know tranquility. To discover what awaits us on the other side of this fight, beyond the torment. That does not excuse my absence, for which I struggle to forgive myself. \n\nI will never forget how you cared for me after my escape from the Hellmouth. You provided me with hope after I had lost all, and compassion when I believed I deserved none. You made me feel myself again.\n\nI have stolen strength from the Darkness, imagining it would lead to a changed world after all of this. There would be peace. A cure for you. A warm cup of jasmine tea between old friends.\n\nIt was an end that justified the means.\n\nI make a solemn vow today to you, Asher: I will have our revenge. I am powerful beyond our enemy's anticipation. The abominable Hive will be exterminated, and Savathûn's illusions of sovereignty will be broken. The vile family line will end with the Witch Queen. I will not stop there. The Vex will have their day. I will scream your name, so it echoes for eternity as I banish them in time to rust and decay and be forgotten.\n\nOur enemies sought to corrupt us from the inside. They believed us compromised and invaded, but our infections will be healed through my actions. They were unaware that we were siphoning knowledge. We are the infections now, and we will rot them out.\n\nToo many of my friends have disappeared. Paranoia warns me more will follow. I must act quickly. Your legacy will not be forgotten, and your work will fuel the eventual Vex deletion. I will see a monument built in your honor. Rest assured, till our Light shines together again.","name":"To Asher Mir","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/5f3e43b5095b76659ab52863d91f453e.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1570455213,"index":1445,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1570455202":{"displayProperties":{"description":"You believed yourself clever, unassailable, and omniscient. For too long, you were. Manipulating and pulling at our strings, howling at our failings. The Black Needle punctured our deficiencies, injecting fear and doubt into our cause.\n\nYou have grown greedy, Witch. Your ambition has forced you to overextend your reach. You have revealed your weaknesses and, through Stasis, I have become powerful enough to rid us of your curse on existence. We control the Darkness and the Light now, and it will be your undoing. Your hands are wet with the blood of my allies. I have not forgotten the suffering your meddling has caused. We saw you, the puppet master behind Oryx's plot. We heard your screams as Crota met his end. Your cowardice will conceal you no longer.\n\nI am coming for you. \n\nI will be your end. As your elders before you and your progeny after you fall, and all that surrounds you crumbles, Eris Morn will stand in front of you, smiling as I wipe your name from the Pantheon of Gods. You will suffer a humiliating defeat as your power dwindles and your influence withers. \n\nWe will laugh at your demise. You will become a fascination. Children will sing songs and tell cautionary tales of the old witch whose avarice deprived her of her desires. You will fade into fable and, eventually, nothing. A bygone dream of pains no more.\n\nDo you understand this clearly, Savathûn? \n\nWe are no longer forced to endure your torture. There is no veil for you to hide behind. We see you plainly. Your orchestration has led to too many foul notes. All your attempts to subjugate this power have failed.\n\nYou are a plague, and we are the cure. Your army will be eradicated, and the Hive will be a layer of dust, cushioning our footsteps. Trust me—you will hate it. \n\nI find myself giddy at these thoughts. Revenge suits me, it seems. I no longer know fear. I am overcome with certainty. When next we come face-to-face, I will remove the bandages that shield me, so I may see you for all you are and all you are not.

I am certain the rumors that circulate in the Tower have found their way to you: Eris Morn has been compromised, corrupted by the Darkness. You and I know that could not be further from reality. You have stood by me, and we have been empowered, enlightened, and vivified. We have struck a balance.\n\nThere is much that you are already aware of. You have seen how the Darkness does not seek to subjugate, as the Light does not. They are tools. They are choices. They are made to be commanded and controlled. This is clear now.\n\nAlong the path, you have been the only consistent allies worth trusting. I have my doubts about the Stranger and, similarly, the Drifter. If they fail us, or worse—attempt to deceive us—we will have to continue on without their support. I do not fear that possibility. As long as we are together, we will be unstoppable. We can recover what has been stolen from us and procure retribution for that which is irreparable.\n\nWe finally have control over the Darkness and can use it against those who seek to destroy us. All of us now have the means to persevere and win this war. Any Cabal insurrection will be thwarted before it's allowed to endanger. The Vex will be banished to some forgotten time. The Fallen will surrender, or perish. And what of Savathûn and her forces? They will bend until they break into decomposing pieces of refuse. Stasis provides an answer to where we have fallen short previously. Use this power, with me, to abolish our foes and prevent what our forbearers could not. The next Collapse is here, and we must abandon our previous misconceptions of right and wrong.\n\nYou are aware of the stakes, so I will leave you with a word of warning:\n\nThe new Collapse did not come from the Darkness alone. It comes from all around. It comes from within… and the assault has already begun. \n\nThis campaign is far from over, so there is much to prepare for. We will be the masters of our fates once more. I cannot wage this war alone. I need you. All of you. I know what I ask: for you to face the unknown. Use forces beyond our comprehension.

The Lightbearer chewed on a bit of tough gray root. He had softened it over the fire and its sour flavor had mellowed into something approaching black pepper. To his surprise, he found himself enjoying it.\n\nHe interrupted his Ghost.\n\n\"You've explained how it's supposed to work, and I've explained that I don't care,\" he said with playful finality. \"I don't like any of the names you've suggested. And either we both get new names, or neither of us do.\"\n\nThe Ghost flew down to eye level, where its shell appeared iridescent purple in the firelight. \"I have had several good names already,\" it replied. \"I enjoyed some of them quite a bit.\"\n\nThe Lightbearer shook his head. \"You said I had a name before as well, but you won't tell me what it was.\"\n\n\"Can't,\" it corrected him. The Lightbearer fell silent.\n\nThe Ghost emitted a static sigh. \"Purely as a hypothetical exercise,\" it said carefully, \"what would you name me?\"\n\n\"You are… a light in the darkness,\" the Lightbearer began, and paused. He stumbled over the sudden weight of his words.\n\nFrom the beginning, this little Ghost had been the only thing keeping him going. It seemed every Guardian he met had little interest in him except to hold him accountable for the unknown sins of his past, but this almost unbearably earnest Ghost had mended him again and again.\n\nIt nourished him with its encouragement and its inexplicable single-minded faith in him. It showed him compassion. Sometimes, when he writhed awake with a hot knot of nameless anxiety in his belly, the Ghost would rest on his chest and hum to him until he fell back to sleep.\n\nThe Lightbearer took a breath to regain his composure. \"And thus, I name thee Sparky.\"\n\nThe Ghost emitted a pained groan, contracted in the air, and fell to the ground, where it lay facedown in the leaf litter.\n\nThe Lightbearer smiled. \"I'm sensing some reluctance, Sparky.\"\n\nThe Ghost gave the barest pulse and rolled itself over in the leaves—a tiny, lazy movement. It dimmed its light to a bare flicker. \"It's terrible,\" it said flatly.\n\n\"Picky,\" the Lightbearer sniffed. \"Very well. I can do better.\" The Ghost warily resumed hovering.\n\n\"How do you feel about Gleam?\" he asked. \"Flash? Or maybe Glint?\"\n\n\"Glint?\" A rainbow of colors played across the Ghost's eye. This usually meant he was calculating complex enemy behavior, determining combat outcomes, or mapping hundreds of bullets and their millions of possible trajectories. \"Oh, I like Glint!\"\n\nThe Lightbearer drew to his feet by the fire and bowed deeply. \"Then it is an honor to meet you, Master Glint.\" He reached out a finger and wiggled one of Glint's points in greeting. The absurdity of the gesture delighted the little Ghost.\n\n\"And now that you have a name,\" said the Lightbearer, \"perhaps I will be more open to ideas as we search for mine.\" Glint dipped in the air, acknowledging his partner's progress. The pair smothered their fire earlier than usual that night.\n\nThe next morning, a passer-by saw Glint's Lightbearer without his helmet. The Titan beat him mercilessly with her flaming hammer, snapping his collarbone and crushing his pelvis. He died hours later of internal hemorrhage. Glint brought him back and the pair traveled in silence for a long while.","name":"I: Sparky and the Scrivener","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4d98e3885b17410029116c5ab42cead9.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":915662499,"index":1448,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"915662496":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The Ether pipes rattled their arrhythmic beat as they greeted a new arrival in the Spider's lair.\n\nHe entered with hesitance. Gold eyes flitted around the room like a nervous animal. His clothes were those of a traitor. The white shawl of a funerary covering draped across shoulders that hunched downward as if a heavy burden rested on them. He was thin from hunger, broken by the cruelty of a face he did not recognize, but others reviled. Out of \"compassion\" he was given a space to rest: a modicum of privacy amid the rattling pipes.\n\nThe Spider, with one hand at his mouth, perched so far forward on his throne that it dipped down toward the floor. \"Nothing? \" he asked one of his lieutenants, who offered a wordless shake of his head in response.\n\n\"And you're sure? This isn't just some…\" Spider waved one hand in the air, as if gesturing to his point. \"Some clever ruse?\" The silence that Spider was met with may as well have been a resounding affirmative.\n\n\"Fascinating.\" Spider grunted as he slid forward off of his throne. He landed on the floor with surprising grace, but when he walked, it was with an ambling gait—a feigned weakness. He dismissed his lieutenant with a flippant gesture and traipsed toward the nearby storage room. The pipes were quieter in there, but only just.\n\nSeated on the floor, wrapped in the tattered white cloth of his burial shroud, the man once known as Prince Uldren Sov looked up to the wide shadow Spider cast in the doorway. He rose to his feet, then bowed. \"Baron,\" he said mistakenly, unaware that Spider neither held no such a title, nor led a great house. Spider's response was a smug laugh, though he tried to temper it behind smiling words.\n\n\"You look like the underside of a Dreg's boot,\" Spider opined as he glided into the room with a silence that belied his stooped posture and uneven gait. His guest—a Lightbearer, no less—turned to his Ghost in a moment of uncertainty.\n\n\"We've had better days,\" was the Ghost's response. Spider restrained himself from criticizing the Ghost for intruding on the conversation and pointedly ignored him.\n\n\"My boys said they found you adrift in space, that your ship ran into some… debris,\" Spider said. \"Awful generous of them to… retrieve you.\" The Spider circled, slowly, blue eyes glowing in the gloom of the dimly lit space. Up close, he carefully assessed the Lightbearer's posture, his expressions, and even something as intimate and subtle as his scent. \"How long were you trapped up there, in the vacuum? Dying and being reborn… over and over again?\"\n\nThe Lightbearer slouched, and his gold eyes averted to the floor at the memory. \"Long enough to know what eternity feels like. Long enough to know I'd never escape without…\" he looked up to Spider, to the glow of those Ether-infused eyes. \"Without help.\"\n\n\"That's me,\" Spider said eagerly, \"very helpful. Very helpful indeed.\" Now sure that the Lightbearer didn't recognize him, Spider ambled up close and took an assessing look at his new guest. \"I don't think I caught your name,\" he added—one final test.\n\n\"I…\" The Lightbearer didn't know how to answer. His Ghost was silent too. \"I don't have one.\" It took all of Spider's energy not to burst out in gleeful laughter.\n\n\"Well, that won't do,\" Spider insisted as he laid a hand on the Lightbearer's shoulder. \"That won't do at all. I won't have someone in my care…\" and Spider was careful to emphasize that word, \"without a proper name.\"\n\nWith a sly tone, Spider moved in closer and suggested, \"How about we try one out? Just for a little while. You and me.\" His voice lowered, gravely and hushed. \"What do you think about… Crow?\"\n\nThe Lightbearer's eyes showed no recognition. The Spider's shone with predatory intent.","name":"II: Identity","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4d98e3885b17410029116c5ab42cead9.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":915662496,"index":1449,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"915662497":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The Warlock could handle the war beasts. The Cabal Legionaries were slow enough that she could thin their numbers in the open. Even the massive Centurion wouldn't be an issue once it was alone. But there were three Psions up on the ridge with their rifles trained on her position, and if she moved from behind her boulder, she was finished.\n\nDruis knelt in the coarse red sand and cursed under her breath. She hadn't expected this much opposition. She didn't have the energy to teleport. Getting out of this was going to be painful.\n\nShe took a deep breath, formed a roiling Void grenade in her hand, and—\n\nAn explosion erupted from somewhere on the ridge. Gunshots – not the ozone pop of Cabal Slug Rifles, but the sweet crack of old-fashioned black powder.\n\nThe Centurion barked orders at the Legionaries, but panic quickly won out over commands. Druis heard their guttural cries as something picked them off. Another explosion and the baying war beasts fell quiet.\n\nThe gunfire drew closer, the Centurion bellowed… and then nothing.\n\nDruis cautiously poked her head out from behind her boulder. The Cabal squad lay in heaps around the gully. Remnants of Psions littered the ridge. The air was heavy with thick smoke and the smell of black oil.\n\nIn the midst of the carnage, a lone Hunter holstered his weapon and stepped over a corpse. He walked with tight efficiency; no movement wasted. He was graceful, even for a Hunter. Druis stepped into the open and raised a hand in greeting.\n\n\"'Hoy, Guardian!\" she called. \"I appreciate your handiwork! The name's Druis, and you just saved me a lot of trouble.\"\n\nThe Hunter's expression was hidden by his heavy helmet. He gave a perfunctory wave and knelt to examine the Centurion's weapon.\n\nNow that she was standing, Druis realized she was a full head taller than the Hunter. Suppose everyone seems tall when you're cowering behind a rock, she thought.\n\nShe pulled off her helmet and let the fresh air cool her slate-blue skin. Her dark hair limply unfurled from where it was piled atop her head. She fixed the Hunter with her golden eyes and smiled.\n\n\"I signed up for a simple salvage run,\" she said. \"Transmat some supplies, run 'em to the City. I've had a headache all morning and didn't want anything loud.\"\n\nThe Hunter nodded without looking up and pulled a sparking catalyst from a Slug Rifle.\n\nDruis chuckled. \"It's okay,\" she said, nudging the body of a fallen Legionary with her boot. \"You don't have to talk when you can shoot like that.\"\n\nThe Hunter paused, then stood and faced her.\n\n\"I am… they call me Crow,\" he said, \"and I am glad I could be of some help.\"\n\nThe Hunter's voice was soft and refined, and while it had a frosty edge, it was not unfriendly.\n\n\"Not as glad as I am,\" Druis said. \"The last thing I needed today was to take a rez with this headache. I told the Cabal that, but they wouldn't listen. Rude of 'em.\"\n\nCrow laughed politely. \"That I can understand. After being brought back, I feel out of sorts for hours.\"\n\nHe turned to look for more Cabal weapons and something caught the Warlock's eye. She whooped. The Hunter looked up, ready.\n\n\"I'll be damned!\" cried Druis, pointing to his arm. \"You're Reefborn, aren't you? Earthborn here, but you and me, we still go way back!\"\n\nCrow looked down. A strip of leather had been torn from his gauntlet, and beneath it, his own grey-blue Awoken skin could clearly be seen.\n\nWhen he looked up, Druis had nearly closed the distance between them in a few long strides. His hand hovered over his weapon before the Warlock clapped him on the back.\n\n\"Figured you for one. It was your voice and the way you move.\" The tall woman playfully juked from side to side.\n\nCrow was quiet.\n\nDruis wished she could see the helmeted Hunter's expression. To her relief, there was a beep from the tracker on her belt.\n\n\"Finally, some good news,\" she said. \"We're right on top of the supply coordinates.\" She scanned the area and located the tiny supply ship half-hidden by a rockslide. \"Since you kept this cargo out of the hands of the Cabal, I'd say you're entitled to a cut.\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary,\" Crow said. He shifted his weight and hid his exposed arm behind his back. It was the first awkward movement Druis had seen him make.\n\n\"I didn't say it was necessary,\" she replied. \"Just a kindness between two bright-eyed Awoken. Won't be a minute.\"\n\nShe ducked into the sand-filled hold of the tiny ship and found the shipping crates. Dim red lights blinked on their panels—the seals had broken long ago. She pried the lid off of the closest one. Inside the grime-covered bottles, the liquid still shone with a gentle orange glow. She uncorked one, wiped the neck clean against her vestments, and took a sip. It was bright with honey and salt and burned her throat with a clean, gingery sweetness.\n\n\"We're in luck!\" Druis called as she hopped outside with the bottle. But the Hunter was gone.\n\nDruis placed the bottle on a flat stone and took a seat next to it. Though she did not expect her companion to return, she waited, busying herself by picking dried blood from the velvety hem of her garment. Finally, she sighed, slapped her palms on her thighs, and reached for the drink.\n\n\"To Crow,\" she shrugged.","name":"III: Just a Kindness","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4d98e3885b17410029116c5ab42cead9.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":915662497,"index":1450,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"915662502":{"displayProperties":{"description":"He wasn't afraid of the Scorn at first.\n\nLike anyone else who could spare the bullets, Crow had picked off a few dozen at distance when he found them in the open. Glint had told him they were related to Eliksni somehow, which made sense—they moved like Eliksni—but they just wouldn't stay dead.\n\nWhen their raiding party hit one of the Baron's storehouses, he immediately sent Crow after them. He said the Scorn were \"bad for business,\" but Crow could tell by his benefactor's wet wheezing he wanted revenge.\n\nCrow was stealthy. Careful. But the Scorn could smell, or sense, or something. He was forced to move deeper into their territory, picking his way through welded-together ship husks as the creatures searched for him.\n\nThey had herded him into a kill box: a derelict ship with one way out. Then they started coming inside—and Crow found he much preferred fighting them from hundreds of yards away.\n\nThe Scorn were rotting flesh pressed tight beneath metal, their bodies webbed with scars and fields of boils, malformed flaps of muscle bolted crudely into place, clumps of brown cloth balled into weeping sockets.\n\nCrow reloaded his revolver and dropped three of the smaller ones. Their helmets were thinner, or their bone structure softer—either way, one shot was all it took. The air was filled with the sour smell of wounds festering beneath brass.\n\nChains dragged against metal to his left and Crow spun. A hulking form was pulling its way through a gap in the ship's hull.\n\nCrow fired. Some of the blue pustules that ringed the creature's shoulder burst open. A thin gas rose from the wound and released an acrid smell of cold solvent. He unloaded into the thing's body, corking the tunnel with its corpse.\n\nTwo Stalkers pressed through another gap and moved to flank him. He backpedaled and reloaded, fully aware he was being pushed farther into the corridors of the ship. He turned in time to catch sight of a flaming thurible and ducked, but it collided with the side of his head. His ears rang and his revolver clattered to the floor.\n\nThe Stalkers hooted in excitement as something tackled him. It was one of the big Raiders, its four ropy arms bound with filthy belts. He struggled and felt the leather straps along its forearms twist and crunch. They were caked with dried lymph.\n\nThe Raider was on top of him, mouth howling below its featureless metal faceplate, pinning him to the ground with its larger arms while the smaller two tried to bring its rifle up for a shot.\n\nA jagged claw tore through Crow's cheek as he writhed and kicked in the Raider's grasp. He wrestled the rifle away from his chin and forced it in the direction of the two Stalkers. He groped blindly until his fingers found the trigger; the burst of fire hit the Stalkers and they fell in a screeching heap.\n\nThe Raider roared and twisted the rifle from Crow's grip and flung it away. Freed of the weapon, its frenzied subarms tore at Crow's stomach. He felt claws catch and tear his own leathers, and then they were through, and his waist was slick with blood.\n\nGibbering madly, it pulled him closer to its misshapen teeth. Thin mucus poured from somewhere under the metal faceplate. Down through the thing's lipless chittering mouth. Down into Crow's face.\n\nAnd then he realized the creature was speaking.\n\nThere was a long moment of horror followed by one of pure revulsion. It was one thing to be torn apart by a mindless creature of madness, but this… this would not be allowed.\n\nCrow felt the Light surrounding him more solidly than the arms of the Raider. He kicked off the creature as if underwater and felt his torn stomach lurch.\n\nThe Raider's arms closed on nothing. It looked up in rage as Crow's shifting form tumbled away.\n\nWith one hand down on the rusty deck of the craft, Crow steadied himself. The Light rose from his body like steam. Knife, he thought, and some of the dissipating energy became a blade in his hand.\n\nHe stood. The Raider charged forward, clawed hands clattering against the ground as it skittered toward him. Crow feinted left and pulled his arm across his body, then pivoted and dropped to a knee as he let the knife go.\n\nThe blade was in the creature's chest and the blade was Light and the creature became flame.\n\nThe smoke was pure, the ash clean.\n\nThe Light was Crow's weapon, and as he walked out of the ship, it was the Light that roared again and again and again from his hand.\n\nIt was the Light that drew Glint to Crow as he walked like a pillar of flame in the night.\n\nAnd it was the Light that kept Crow from madness, even as the voice of the thing echoed through his mind:\n\n\"fatherfatherfatherfatherfather\"","name":"IV: Saturno","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4d98e3885b17410029116c5ab42cead9.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":915662502,"index":1451,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"915662503":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Glint checked his coordinates again and entered Spider's subterranean shipping depot.\n\nHe bobbed uncertainly through tight towers of stacked crates, beneath hanging coils of gurgling tubing, over piles of crushed Phaseglass, and through a hissing vent of rich lavender smoke that obscured what looked like a quantum opal. (But as private ownership of such an unstable isotope was utterly forbidden, Glint decided it must be a replica.)\n\nHe found Spider working a bank of consoles in the nexus of the depot. An intricate series of gravity currents filled the air with gently gliding cargo. Rusty iris gates snapped open and shut as Spider directed his goods to unseen corners of his dominion.\n\n\"Tell me about Crow,\" Spider said without looking up. Glint flew closer and caught sight of himself on a small monitor. He saw a mosaic of security feeds—corridors in the Tangled Shore, a strange workshop, Crow's quarters—before Spider collapsed the images and turned to address him directly. \"How has our friend been performing in the field?\"\n\n\"Quite well,\" Glint answered. \"He's feeling more confident, while—\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Spider dismissively. He plucked a cracked chunk of Seraphite from the current of air as it passed, ran his claws over it, then placed it back in the beam. \"Has anyone told him?\"\n\nGlint didn't have to ask for clarification. \"Not outright. He knows he wasn't a good person—he gathered that much from the Guardians who killed him—but he hasn't heard his old name.\"\n\nSpider gave a phlegmy grunt of contentment. \"And there haven't been any indiscretions?\"\n\nGlint's eye flickered and he made an almost imperceptible processing noise. Spider leaned forward. \"Do you have something to tell me?\"\n\n\"It's actually a funny story,\" Glint said. \"He ran across a Warlock who recognized him as an Awoken, and she—\"\n\n\"He was seen?\" Spider shouted, striking the side of a passing crate. A chorus of mewling squeaks rose from within. Glint watched as it floated out of sight.\n\n\"Not seen,\" Glint said. \"She noticed his skin under his gauntlet. He told me he didn't want to risk further exposure, so he left.\"\n\n\"Then he's lying, Glint. Even to you.\" The light in Spider's eyes seemed to dull. One of his smaller arms scratched irritably at his side.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time,\" Glint said softly. \"People talk behind his back. There are rumors someone named Chalco has been following him. He's heard the Scorn call him 'father.' He'll eventually figure it out.\"\n\n\"I gave him rules for a reason.\"\n\n\"Following rules is counter to his nature,\" Glint said blithely, then noticed Spider's scowl. \"Frustrating, I know. He could ask anything of the next Guardian he sees, and I couldn't stop him.\"\n\nSpider growled. \"You will stop him.\"\n\n\"The thing is,\" said Glint, \"someday he'll realize who he was doesn't matter. What's important is who he is.\"\n\n\"Who he is,\" Spider hissed, \"is my investment.

He floated unsteadily for a moment, then rose to Spider's eye level.\n\n\"Baron Spider,\" Glint said respectfully, \"in his short new life, Crow has faced more than his share of cruelty.

He let the anger flow over him, around him, floated in its black waters until only his eyes were left peering over the surface.\n\n\"Thank you, Glint,\" he said, his voice calm. \"I will call for you again if I need you.\"\n\nGlint beeped with pride, dipped in the air respectfully, and zipped away through the stacks of contraband.","name":"V: Theraphosa","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4d98e3885b17410029116c5ab42cead9.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":915662503,"index":1452,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"915662500":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The Ether pipes were howling.\n\nSpider sat hunched to one side of his throne, head in hand, when Crow returned from the field.\n\n\"Baron,\" Crow addressed his ostensible benefactor.

Crow didn't look up, and when he started to answer, Spider cut him off.\n\n\"Guardians can't be trusted,\" was Spider's reminder. \"They can be useful, they can be powerful, but never trusted.\"\n\n\"Baron, I only thought to—\"\n\n\"No!\" Spider bellowed. \"You didn't! If you thought about anything, you wouldn't have exposed…\" Spider caught himself, words turning into a snarled grumble as he laid back in his throne. \"You screwed up.\"\n\nCrow, head bowed and eyes fixed on the floor, said nothing. He knew the Spider's anger, knew his displeasure, and knew his wrath. He held no desire to face it again.\n\n\"But maybe there's some…\" the Spider hesitated and chose his words carefully, \"…wisdom, in your defiance. The Guardians are too good a resource to cast aside, especially on matters beyond our mutual—ah—expertise.\"\n\nIt was only then that Crow looked up, questioningly. For a moment, he felt humbled pride. Perhaps, he believed, that act of defiance had broken through to Spider, revealed Crow as more than a convenient Lightbearer.\n\nThe Spider held out one hand. \"I have an idea to… protect you.\" His offer sounded sincere, even if Spider meant his investment and not Crow as a person. \"Send Glint over.\"\n\nCrow grew tense, looked away, and then thought better of testing another act of defiance so soon. With a nod, he showed his compliance as Glint manifested at his side. The ghost fixed on Crow with a nervous look, then flew up to Spider.\n\n\"What… do you require?\" Glint asked.\n\nInstead of answering, Spider snatched Glint out of the air with one hand. Glint shrieked and Crow stood swiftly, but just as swiftly saw the Arc-pikes of Spider's guards thrust at him. Spider made a clicking noise in the back of his throat and reached for a set of tools nearby. Tools used to pry open the shells of dead ghosts. They would work on living ones just as well.\n\n\"What are you doing?!\" Glint demanded, fear in his voice. Crow stood frozen, having faced Spider's punishment before. But this… this was his Ghost. A part of Crow also feared that perhaps he was misreading the situation. He was so certain that Spider would never do anything to permanently hurt him. But when the Spider shocked Glint into paralysis with a small, needled tool, Crow was disabused of that certainty.\n\n\"Stop!\" Crow cried as Spider wedged a flat tool between Glint's shell plates. \"No!\"\n\nWith a snap, Spider popped one of the casings off. Then he looked up to Crow and switched tools.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" the Spider said in soothing reassurance that flowed like ice through Crow's veins. \"I'm just going to make some… modifications,\" he said, igniting a cutting torch.\n\n\"To better protect you… from the world.\"","name":"VI: Revenant's Switch","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4d98e3885b17410029116c5ab42cead9.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":915662500,"index":1453,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"915662501":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Glint's shell showed the scars of Spider's implements.\n\n\"I'm so sorry.\" Crow's voice was barely a whisper.

The ghost's monocular eye stared up at him and flickered weakly. \"I'm so, so sorry.\"\n\n\"It's all right.\" Glint couldn't blame Crow. \"I—I think I'll be fine. Spider is…\" he had to cautiously choose his next words, \"…very skilled with modifying Ghost architecture.\"\n\n\"He put a bomb inside you!\" Crow hissed, his voice cracking.\n\n\"But I'm still here. Still with you,\" Glint reassured. \"And you still have the Light. That's what matters.\"\n\nCrow looked up to the ceiling, unable to bear the sight of the damage done to his Ghost. He was silent, the room was silent, save for the damnable rattling of those pipes. \"I put you in this position,\" Crow said quietly. \"I let this happen.\"\n\n\"You had no choice. We can't change the past,\" Glint said as he floated up out of Crow's hands a little crookedly; like a bird with an injured wing. \"We can only look to the future.\"\n\nCrow forced himself to gaze down into Glint's single, flickering eye. \"My future is with you. You're all I have.

Live a normal life. Without the Light.\"\n\nCrow's jaw tensed, teeth clenched together. \"No,\" he said through them. \"I won't abandon you. You would never do that to me.\"\n\nThe Ghost looked away in thought for a moment and then bobbed up and down. \"You're right,\" he said as he turned again to face his Lightbearer. Glint floated in and softly tapped his shell to Crow's nose. \"I'll never leave you.\"\n\nCrow reached out and gently took Glint into the palm of his hand. \"We're all we have,\" Crow whispered, pulling his knees in close, and Glint even closer.  \"Spider will never let us go…\"\n\n\"…but at least we have each other.\"","name":"VII: Broken Wing","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/4d98e3885b17410029116c5ab42cead9.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":915662501,"index":1454,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1619425569":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"No!

I just got my first look at Artifact H-349. It's heavier than expected. More than a few people questioned if we even should study something with such a… dire legacy, but if we can't understand our enemies' tools, then we leave ourselves vulnerable to them.\n\n---\n\nProject day 5. Ran our first test of the artifact's… let's call them \"necrotic properties.\" We used cattle; they were large enough to survive the initial discharge. The results have been… upsetting. \n\nNo more animal testing.\n\n ---\n\nProject day 30. Spectral analysis is back, and it's got nothing. The artifact doesn't operate like traditional Hive tech, which is our closest analogue. A cult of deranged fanatics can mass produce knockoffs, but we can't even tell you what it's made from.\n\n ---\n\nProject day 31. We had an accidental discharge. Carro, lab tech over in 4B. Human, so… this is going to be it for him. We've got someone staying with him as the corruption spreads… At the very least, there's so much more to study now as we watch his unfortunate deterioration. He's been babbling since it hit his central nervous system, saying, \"I'm reborn,\" or variations thereof. I think… he almost sounds happy.\n\n---\n\nProject day 39. The Vanguard forbade a postmortem, but a few of us couldn't stomach the idea of Carro's sacrifice being in vain. The results have been insightful. Off the record, I'm keeping a few tissue samples. It almost feels like having him around again. \n\n ---\n\nProject day 41. We began the day with another moment of silence for our lost colleague. Too bad he's not around to appreciate it.\n\n ---\n\nProject day 45. We kept thinking about H-349 as a destroyer. But it's more sophisticated than that. I mean, with a normal gun, it's just… boom. Done. H-349 on the other hand is deadly, not destructive. Much like a viper, its bite does not bring about instant death. Instead, its venom cajoles. It co-opts your beating heart into a death clock, ticking down your last moments. Your own pulse kills you. \n\n Death may be slow and agonizing for its victim. But for the viper, time is an amenable trade for efficiency.\n\n ---\n\nProject day 51. Yanniv has been crying. A lot lately. We must accept that tragedies happen; it's a hard lesson to learn.\n\n ---\n\nProject day 65. Another accidental discharge today. We realized that Yor's little creation is hungry, so we fed it more. It certainly performs in exchange; the activity is intriguing after it feasts. I've been able to follow Yanniv's degradation with a more analytical mind than when we lost Carro. I have to say, the process is so elegant; the science involved almost seems poetic. It may be reproducible. Just imagine how much more I could've learned if the scanners were all active at the time.\n\n ---\n\nProject day 77. Another accidental discharge.

They had begun to harden and gain a translucent metallic sheen, increasingly stained by drippings as his eye wandered higher. The missing associates hung impaled at their apex as tarnished crowns. The spines fed upon them, and Gaelin could see the planted stems weaving together at the base. The Wrathborn yanked the tendril from its back and planted it. They quivered. A hint of a voice. Gaelin would look upon them no longer.\n\nHe formed a vortex of Void in his palm and slung it beneath the Wrathborn. It stumbled backward as the grenade burned away. Behind it, the Fallen bodies disintegrated, but the spires remained unscathed and thirsty. The Wrathborn turned to pursue him, ripping at the ground, ceiling, and walls for holds.\n\nThe Guardian ran and dove over a line of Web Mines at the cave mouth. He cloaked as the Wrathborn was barraged by their spheres of Arc disruption.\n\nNivviks and Vynriis pelted the beast with Wire Rifle shots, fending off tendrils and drawing attention from Gaelin-4. The Guardian nocked a Void-Light bolt and cast his Shadowshot into the Wrathborn's chest, drawing its limbs in with crushing gravity. The trio drew Arc-cage stake-points and flung them into position around the incapacitated Wrathborn. As the last stake made connection, the Arc-cage sprung and shocked the beast into unconscious submission.\n\nMorning light trickled over the horizon as the three finished tying down the cage for transfer.\n\n\"Better this time,\" Nivviks croaked. \"Cave is unsettling.\"\n\n\"Web Mines were a good idea,\" the Guardian replied. He sighed. \"I strongly advise you demo that cave.\"\n\n\"Agreed. I will call for a Ketch.\" Nivviks stepped away, shouting back, \"Enjoy your liquor and whelp.\"\n\nGaelin-4 smirked.\n\nVynriis checked the cage's seals and looked to Gaelin. \"What will the Guardian call his War Beast?\"\n\n\"Castus.\"\n\n\"A good hound.\"","name":"Wild Hunt Cloak","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"Hide in shadow.","hash":2362912735,"index":1463,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3225000411":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I\n\n\"Welcome, my wily new friend.

They sported Wire Rifles and Short Daggers on their harnesses. \"Depends… This bounty from Arrha; mark is a month in the wind.\"\n\nLaughter blustered from the hulking Eliksni's mouth. \"Your ilk, always so direct. Down to business. I like that… that acumen.\" The Spider gestured forward with his lower arms, and an associate plunked a small metal crate before Gaelin-4. \"I assure you, they are still very much in the neighborhood.\"\n\nThe associate unclasped the lid. Two Golden Age era bottles of amber liquid nestled in padded cloth glistened in the lair's uneven lighting. The shadowed man behind Spider bent forward for a better view.\n\nGaelin-4 approached and lifted the craft-glass bottle. \"For me?\" He asked with a smirk. \"This must be a crap job.\"\n\n\"Directly from my private selection.

Attention is required elsewhere, and this is a personal matter.\" The syndicate boss turned each of his four hands over one after the other. \"However, you will be using an invention of his. Clever, but keep that to yourself. Compliments get away from him.\"\n\n\"Alive?\" Gaelin-4 turned the bottle in his hand.\n\n\"That's right.

She nodded to Spider and shouldered her rifle, then fell in line.\n\nThe Exo's eyes flicked to the man in the shadows. \"Exile,\" he said, bending his head in a courteous nod.\n\n\"Mind your business, Guardian.\" The man's voice was even and measured. \"And good luck.\"\n\nGaelin-4 smiled, took his Transfiguration from the doorman. \"Osiris,\" he muttered under his breath as he crossed the exit. \"I knew it.\"","name":"Wild Hunt Mask","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"Be ever vigilant.","hash":3225000411,"index":1464,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3996418706":{"displayProperties":{"description":"IV\n\nVynriis was the first to spot movement. Twenty meters, against the horizon. A lumbering hulk of muscle and high-density Cabal plating indolently ascended a stone column in her firing line. It huffed air deeply, leapt forward, and impacted the ground with dead-weight grace on two armored trunks. The tremor ran through her bones.\n\nThe trio swapped to close-band comms. \"Beast in sights.\"\n\nGaelin-4 and Nivviks slowly crawled to her side, taking care not to draw attention in the quiet night. The beast was Cabal all right, red-paint-scraped armor of the Legion buckled against an outpouring of muscle and blistering flesh. From its back and stomach, bladed tendril mutations slithered through gaps in the armor. Its hands were fused in an ever-grip around two massive cleavers that ploughed trenches in the soil as it trundled toward the flames.\n\n\"It appears… abnormal for a Wrathborn,\" Vynriis noted.\n\n\"Old. Perhaps one of the first. An escapee of the Crow's?\" Nivviks mused. \"Preventable. Spider will be displeased.\"\n\nThe Wrathborn Gladiator tore into the wrecked transport. Licks of flame seared its exposed meat without notice, and remnant oil set the Gladiator's cleavers alight in patches.\n\n\"I'll handle this. Excuse me.\" Gaelin-4 stood and strode directly toward the Wrathborn. It lurched to face him and loosed a tortured bellow. Gaelin snapped a smoke bomb into his hand with a flicker of Void Light and flung it into the Wrathborn's mouth. After a muted pop, dull purple smoke poured from its head, and the Wrathborn reeled in the fumes; bloodcurdling shrieks cast plumes of smoke like clouds against the starry backdrop.\n\nGaelin knelt and shouldered Transfiguration. He sent four heavy Arc rounds that cracked splits in the Wrathborn's helm. It howled and stampeded towards him; tendrils lance-hooked into the dirt to rip its body forward faster. It tripped the Shadowshot he had set. Void Light tethered the Wrathborn, anchoring it at the core of its existence. The beast whiplashed and lost its footing; face struck floor—shattering its helmet.\n\n The mad thing rose, smoke billowing from its nostrils like a hellion. It wrenched with every fiber of strength, veins bursting to break.\n\n\"Keep pullin' like that and you'll tire yourself out.\" Gaelin-4 sauntered around the Wrathborn, darting stake-points into the ground to form the Arc-cage's cornerstones. He pulled the third from his belt when he felt something snap within him. It broke the Void tether?\n\nFrom the dying smoke launched a tendril. He ducked it and saw the fiery blade just quick enough to roll over it and into invisibility. He flicked another smoke bomb into his hand and struck the beast between the eyes. It flailed and sent tendrils in his direction. Gaelin rolled back and came up, rifle forward. He dropped the first two and began to reposition when the ground erupted beneath him. A tendril pierced his thigh and dangled him in the air as two more drove at his head and chest. He cracked a spike grenade against his knee. The stick sputtered and beamed with Void Light. He severed the oncoming tendrils with the beam, and they gushed soulfire like a fissured dam.\n\nThe torrent incinerated the grenade and half of Gaelin-4's right arm. His rifle fell. Before the thought to reach became action, the Wrathborn slammed the Exo to the floor and pinned his leg. Gaelin's breath tremored. It raised its horrid cleavers. He drew Lonesome from under his cloak and shot the thing in the eye. It cast him across the site and through a stony point protruding from the ground. Shards of broken rock cascaded around the Guardian. Gaelin clutched a puncture in his chest, a barb of stone protruded from it. The throw had shattered his hip. He was unable to stand, and it was getting dimmer. A shadow in his vision. Lightning wires overhead.

But how many were needles?\n\nAfter only a few minutes of reading, she knew: it had happened before.

Post-reset, became a lone raider.\n—Vander-2/3: Rescued from the Great Disaster because reset incapacitated him. Served as City guard post-reset. Ghost destroyed on Luna. (Pre- or post-reset? Do Ghosts protect Exo Guardians from spontaneous reset?) \n—Lilakee-5/6/7: Curious case. Known sufferer of severe DER-related nightmares and outbursts. Commandeered a jumpship and vanished.\n—Selass-7/8: Technician sent to data mine Titan settlements. Reset occurred in return transit. Post-reset, remained research technician assisting Cryptarchs.\n\nThese were Exos that had seemingly rebooted themselves; they had wiped away their own identities and taken a new number. Or had someone else somehow done it for them? Could there be records of some of them outside the archive? Could one or two still be alive?\n\nLakshmi-2 closed her eyes, slowed her breathing, and focused on the dichotomy of her emotions. What she'd discovered felt momentous, but she knew her colleagues would treat it as a curiosity. People often discounted Exos. It was if there were a line between frame and flesh and blood. The idea offended Lakshmi-2, but at the same time, she knew Exos were different enough from normal Humans. The existence of Exos who reset themselves—for whatever reason—proved that.\n\nOr did they?\n\nA quick search of the medical archives turned up ailments and causes considered quackery by the Golden Age: psychogenic amnesia, dissociative fugue, retrograde memory loss, personal obliteration, betrayal theory…\n\nWhat did it all mean?\n\nLakshmi-2 felt uncertain, and that always boded ill.","name":"Legacy's Oath Grips","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"Certainty is our greatest asset.

The entranced Servitor had dimmed, and foul-smelling liquid spilled from punctures and rutted gashes in its plating. Trihn looked the machine over curiously. It was an oddity this far from the Shore, and to be left unprotected was even stranger.\n\nToppled in the dirt, an Arc spear tip drew her eye to an open case of digging tools, high-tensile strength line, and respirator filters— and just beyond: the wheezing Captain. Trihn scooped the spear from the ground and walked the few short steps to him.\n\n\"What name do you go by, cur of Driksys?\" Her Eliksni was of the Shore, a crudeform result of the elegant language diluted by Sol-domestic phrases and pronunciations.\n\nThe Captain thrashed and rolled onto its back, snapping quills like kindling. It propped itself on rough-hewn fleshy stubs to extend its reach and swiped at her with its single remaining arm. Froth spilled from its cracked mask, and underneath a broken section at the brow-line, a maddened eye fixated on her.\n\n\"What's wrong with him?\"\n\n Shakto materialized at Trihn's side. \"I don't know. Presenting physiology is Fallen, but altered.

He'll be forced to deal with us eventually.\"\n\nTrihn swiped a spent Ether canister from the Captain and held it up to the light. \"Shakto.\"\n\n\"Looks clean to me,\" the Ghost said after a focused scan.\n\nTrihn tossed the canister to shatter on the ground and moved back to the unopened crates. She cracked off one of the lids with the spear and set both aside. Just short of a dozen full fragile vials containing delicate blue jostled within soft packaging. Save a few with froth percolating through worn seals, the Ether swished like plasma-fluid surf inside the glass. \"They wouldn't leave this much unattended.\"\n\nShakto followed the dirt-dragged trail back from the Captain to a curve in the stony walls of the gulley. The trail led him to a narrow separation in the rock face. \"Trihn.\"\n\nIt was enough space to contort her body through. Scrapes ran from the edges of the split into a slithering dark tunnel. Trihn took a stone from the ground and rolled it in her hands, coaxing condensed smoothness from it with palms of Void-Light. She flicked the glowing sphere into the separation and watched it roll a few meters along a line before it skipped over the edge and fell steeply out of sight.\n\n\"You think it fell straight through the Reef?\"\n\n\"I'd say no. That rope goes somewhere.\"\n\nTrihn squeezed shallow breaths into her lungs with each shuffling step. It was all the stone pressing on her ribs would allow. She closed her eyes to keep instinctual panic in check and lurched forward with a final step to meet the precipice. The walls opened; her lungs filled. Line dangled beneath her feet. She grabbed the line and tested the solidity of the ground-spike holding it in place.\n\n\"Shakto, I'm going down.\"\n\nSeveral meters deep in the darkness, buzzing spelunking lights set a grizzly scene aglow. Three Vandals, two Dregs, and a Captain lay slain and lifeless and ripped agape—some residually twitching from Arc blade cuts. Near the Captain, two severed arms bled pools. A third arm, prosthetic, was pinned to an adjacent stone wall with a spear. Her breath trembled. She knew this violence.

Trihn stepped forward and ungloved her hand. She pressed her palm to the onyx-colored metal spires. Something quivered within, and came alive.\n\n\"What are you?\" she would ask, over the concerned interjections of her Ghost. The Answer, it would reply to her, alone. At least, the first time.

It showed her the betrayal Driksys coated her opponent's blades with. It showed her tools they meant to rip apart her Ghost with.

She had thought that metal does not grow; it is only reshaped or reduced, but upon reflection, had come to accept aggregation was growth. Trihn returned with tools retrieved from her Pike: some gifts, some collected from marks that no longer needed them, all worn from extended use. Dilution fluid ransacked from the parked Pikes would steady the process. Three canisters of Ether swiped from the encampment dangled around her neck in a makeshift sling while the rest were left stowed in her vehicle's saddlebags.

A thick flaxen braid ran down the midsection of his head, fading into stubbled sides that fed a sumptuous beard.\n\n\"It is.\" Petra looked the man over. \"That's not a common fashion for a Guardian.\"\n\n\"Grew in during the Red War. It took a liking to me.\" Siegfried stroked his chin. \"Will your soldiers be ready to move once we arrive?\"\n\n\"At nightfall.\" Her hand was outstretched, holding field notes. \"You understand what you're facing?\"\n\nSiegfried took them and slid the note packet into his breastplate beneath a Cormorant Seal. \"Innumerable Hive.\"\n\n\"Yes, and particularly vicious ones.\"\n\n\"That has always been my experience.\" Siegfried smiled. \"I'm sure your Corsairs will allow no harm to come to me. I will do the same for them.\"\n\n\"They'll be relieved to have a Guardian leading the charge.\"\n\n\"My briefing mentioned fauna being afflicted by a pervasive infestation?\"\n\nPetra kept the worry from her face. \"Recently sapient beings have begun to show symptoms as well.\"\n\n\"It's spreading.\" The Praxic Titan leaned forward. \"How have you combated this?\"\n\n\"Intelligence suggests the Hive congregate around some sort of relic. We believe it is the affliction's point of origin.\" Petra pointed to his breastplate. \"Your notes provide more details.\"\n\n\"It is my understanding I am not to destroy this relic. Why?\"\n\n\"'Whatever the Hive bow to in the dark: secure it, intact,'\" she quoted. \"It represents too many unknowns to discard without examination.\"\n\n\"That is not my perspective. The Hive exist to purge or be purged. I say we oblige them.\" Siegfried turned to The Queen's Wrath. \"My feelings aside, you are the commanding officer of this expedition. I will comply.\"\n\n\"Do so with care. You alone are cleared to approach the relic. My Corsairs don't enjoy the protection of the Light, and I want them keeping a safe distance once the nest is clear.\"\n\n\"Very well. Still, know my recommendation to the Vanguard will only be in support of eradication or containment.\"\n\n\"The Reef will take note of their opinions. For now, I imagine the Vanguard are rather focused on Europa. At least, if what I hear from Eris is accurate.\"\n\n\"Eris Morn is a traitor.\" Siegfried's voice was stern, his eyes locked with Petra's.\n\n Her lip convulsed in a silent snarl. \"The information she shares would suggest otherwise.\" Petra turned away from Siegfried as the skimmer-craft dipped beneath the fog. She thought of Eris's last letter, the sighting of Variks. Pieces in motion. Coats turning or bisected. Wartime nuances. \"Maybe this deployment will be good for you.\"\n\n\"Anywhere my Light can send shadows into retreat is a good deployment.\"","name":"Wild Hunt Gauntlets","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"Strike relentlessly.","hash":2731591698,"index":1511,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2605530826":{"displayProperties":{"description":"III\n\nDusk set over the Dreaming City. Six Corsairs sporting Tigerspite Rifles made final checks on their gear. Movement became still salutes as Petra and Siegfried approached the staging ground. Just ahead, nestled in the Divalian Mists, menaced a fetid pit trimmed in Hive bio-growth. Frenetic inhuman whispers echoed from within like hoarse cords screaming.\n\nField holos displayed maps of twisting tunnelways all orbiting one central chasm. Within the nest, a point flagged their objective. Approach markers tracked the most direct path through.\n\n\"At ease, Corsairs. This is Siegfried. He is here to assist you in flushing the Hive from this nest and reclaiming our land. Inside, he is in command. My guard and I will hold this forward station. You all know what to do. For the Queen.\" Petra pivoted to allow Siegfried the floor. \"Titan.\"\n\n\"Well met, Awoken of the Reef. The Vanguard stands with you. I am the spearhead. Advance on me and we will prevail.\" Siegfried donned his helmet. \"I will not fail you.\"\n\nThe fireteam embarked, and in the subterranean ever-dark, the Hive descended upon them. Droves of Thrall choked the tunnels as gunfire deluge hammered from behind rallying barricades without pause. Siegfried lit the hollow with brilliant Arc fulmination, and rounds found targets. Claws drew blood and rent armor, but neither Titan nor Corsair wavered. Seven entered and seven stood. With each break in the flood, they took ground under cover of storm.\n\nSiegfried arced through the filth like a deadly spark. Each charge scattered the opposition, leaving only crackling chitin, expended shells, and galvanized ozone.\n\nSoulfire fumes fouled the air as reinforcements phased into ritual circles. Acolytes loped to flank the Titan only to be cut off by Corsair suppressing fire. Siegfried faced down a towering Knight with a man-hewing blade. He formed two flashbangs in his fists and lunged with a blinding combo. The Knight shrieked, narrowly missing Siegfried's head with its cleaver. The Titan launched forward, and the fiend fell to the rolling tempest. Labored breathing was the only sound that remained. The Titan looked to a blocked tunnelway in the floor before them.\n\nSlick Hive excretion lined the chasm ahead. \"This must be their sanctum.\" Siegfried's palm pulsed with Light. The faint silhouette of a Ghost popped in and out of existence. \"Yes. This is it. Fall back and form a perimeter. If I don't return, you are to retreat.\"\n\n Siegfried ripped through the mucus-seal and slid into the dim cavern. Foul fluid trickled from the ceiling in drips and spattered in pools at his feet. A monument of gore writhed before him. Soft tendrils convulsed around a jaundiced grim glow. They grew from the twisted base of an eviscerated Knight—its back and ribs pulled through its split abdomen, bending inside-out in half-completed metamorphosis.\n\n\"You vile thing.\" Siegfried walked slowly, his sight focused on the grotesque shrine. The Knight's eyes followed his every step. He was mere meters from the horror when the earth burst on either side of him. Two Ogres stumbled from chitin-covered sacs he had mistaken for walls. He drew his Invective and with well-placed blasts, dispatched the first. Siegfried turned to the second, but it was already upon him. It batted him into a cavern wall and wailed as energy beamed from its eye.\n\nSiegfried raised a towering barricade just as the Ogre unleashed its hellish gaze. Cracks webbed through the Light wall. Siegfried braced it with both hands. The Ogre shook the ground as it bore down on him. The Titan readied himself to clash, lightning welling in his bones.\n\n Movement in the distance. [CRACK] The Ogre's head snapped sideways from a forceful hit. Siegfried followed the sound to a figure perched in the mouth of a tunnel opposite of him. The Ogre turned and roared— [CRACK] Its head blew back, oozing from a raw wound. Three more shots followed from the figure, bringing the Ogre to its knees. The man looked at Siegfried and performed a small bow. The Titan dispersed his shield and seized the Ogre by the neck. He slammed the wounded thing to the ground and brought both fists down with a bolt of electricity and a killing blow. The Titan turned to confront his rescuer but saw only an empty tunnel.\n\nIt was early morning before Siegfried surfaced again. Petra stood stone-still in the camp.\n\n\"I retrieved your samples. You should know that anything I removed regenerated…\" Siegfried lowered his voice. \"…I believe this was a germinal site. Either lady luck is with us, or this was an ambitious expansion off a larger site.\"\n\n\"We're never lucky,\" Petra replied grimly. \"I'll begin narrowing down options for our next strike.\"\n\n\"That line of thinking will be reflected in my report to the Vanguard.\"\n\n\"You've done more than enough for today, Sir Titan. Rest. Tomorrow we'll take the samples to the Techeuns. I'm sure they'll have plenty to say.\"","name":"Wild Hunt Plate","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"This thing we were hunting, it was smart.

He turned around.\n\nA barrel in his bare face. A hooded Awoken behind it, with features obscured by a thin shawl wrap from the eyes down. \"Stop. Following. Me.\"\n\nSiegfried raised his hands. His Ghost materialized. \"Stay back, Ogden!\" the Praxic Striker called out.\n\n\"Now see here!\" Ogden shouted, \"I will not watch two brothers of the Light do battle. Calm yourselves!\"\n\nA second Ghost materialized. \"Glint. Be careful,\" whispered the figure.\n\n\"We're all on the same side here,\" Glint said meekly.\n\nA Corsair stepped through the mist, rifle pointed at the hooded figure. \"Lay down your arms and come peacefully.\"\n\n\"Oh no.\" Glint looked to the hooded man. \"Wait, Cro—mh.\"\n\nHeat flashed from the hooded man's free hand.\n\n\"'Crome,' is it?\" Siegfried inquired. \"Never heard of you.\"\n\n\"Crome\" spun and threw a crude Solar blade, splitting the Corsair's rifle and slashing his hand. Siegfried moved to disarm; he caught Crome's turning jaw with an electrified fist, but missed the gun. Crome floundered back several paces and dove into the mists.\n\n\"What a disrespectful man,\" Ogden shouted. \"That kind of conduct cannot be allowed.\"\n\n\"I'll put a stop to it,\" Siegfried assured him.\n\nSilhouettes stumbled through fog. Ghosts dematerialized. Corsair radios muddled with chatter. Crome skulked until quiet surrounded him, interrupted by a small burst of propulsion in the mist.\n\nSiegfried was far above him, plummeting through the mist like a coiled storm. Crome glanced upward and took off sprinting. The Striker's fists shattered the ground behind him in thunderous havoc. Crome darted away and twisted, landing on his feet with Dire Promise ready. Siegfried bolted directly toward Crome like living lightning. Each fanned shot from the man's cannon was struck down by bolts arcing from the Titan. Siegfried led with a shoulder. Crome dashed around him and brought Solar flame to form in his hand—\n\n\"Too slow!\" Siegfried whipped a crackling elbow into Crome's stomach and blocked the counterattack. The Titan delivered a knee to the man's ribs that chained into three lightning-fast strikes across the Hunter's body—ending in a thundercrack blow to the temple.\n\nCrome grunted and struggled to maintain his footing.\n\nSiegfried stood emblazoned in voltaic fury. \"You're outclassed.\"\n\n \"I'm pretty good at taking punishment,\" Crome jabbed through clenched, bloodied teeth.\n\n\"Surrender. I won't ask again.\"\n\n\"I can't do that. I'm here to hel—\"\n\nSiegfried charged without hesitation, but Crome was ready this time. Instead of retreating, he leapt forward with a searing blade. Siegfried caught his wrist millimeters before the blade made contact but lost his footing. They grappled in the dirt. Siegfried pried the knife from Crome's hand.\n\n\"Enjoy that,\" Crome said, skidding away from the Titan with a kick to the midsection. The blade turned molten and engulfed Siegfried in a fiery explosion.\n\nThe Striker rose from the blast-cloud, coughing. \"Damned knives…\" Crome was quickly disappearing into the mist.\n\n\"Enough running!\" His voice erupted as he slammed electrified fists into the ground. The shockwave rippled through the dirt and tripped the running Hunter. Siegfried took a step forward. The Hunter rolled to face him, gun red-hot. A beam of Solar destruction sizzled through the mist, clipping Siegfried's pauldron before he could react and knocking him to the floor.\n\nSiegfried could hear the Corsairs nearby. Disoriented and livid, the Titan found his feet, but not his foe. The Hunter was gone. No amount of searching with the Corsairs would change that, but Siegfried kept them looking all through the night just the same.","name":"Wild Hunt Mark","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"Show your pride.","hash":2932601761,"index":1513,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1221846797":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I\n\n\"Cousin Zavala.

Curtains drawn; it was one of few dim sources providing light to the room. \"Condolences are not enough.\"\n\n\"The worlds may be gone, but their gravity remains… in more ways than one.\" Zavala cleared his throat. \"How can the Vanguard be of assistance to the Queen's Wrath?\"\n\nIkora bowed her head in acknowledgement but did not look up from her datapad. Her eyes scoured intelligence reports from Europa, the Tangled Shore, Luna, beyond the pale, the list went on.\n\n\"I'm afraid my news won't improve the mood.\" Petra took a deep breath. \"What I'm about to divulge to you is privileged information. It cannot leave our confidence.\"\n\nIkora's attention broke from her datapad. \"Is that so? Information related to the Reef Queen's broadcast?\"\n\n\"A separate one sent afterward, entrusted to me.

Why have you called?\"\n\n\"The Cabal Empire is on the move.\"\n\n\"That is concerning,\" Ikora said, finally relinquishing her datapad to power down on Zavala's desk.\n\nIndignation twitched across Zavala's brow. \"How many times must we bury them?\"\n\n\"Potentially once more, Commander.\"\n\n\"'Empire' implies their forces have coalesced around central leadership.

A disease, of Hive origin.\"\n\nIkora eyed the datapad. \"Petra, a Hidden report details an encounter with an afflicted beast in Soriks's Cut. It bled soulfire.\"\n\n\"Osiris can confirm increased Hive activity throughout the system.\" The Commander looked to Ikora, then to Petra. \"Let's get ahead of this.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've spoken to Osiris.

Full of dread. Recite it to the Techeuns.\"\n\n\"Foreboding. I'll relay the message; does it have a meaning?\"\n\n\"A dream. Maybe nothing, but…\" She saw that Petra understood.\n\n\"You say the Hive are more active?\" Zavala interjected. \"They're up to something.\"\n\n\"More violent, if that's imaginable.

It's desecrated.\" Siegfried swiped the samples into his satchel from the gear rack in his tent.  \"In truth, I'd prefer you remained stowed until we departed.\"\n\n\"You were not so rude as a boy, you know.\" The Ghost squinted at his Titan. \"When I express concern Master Siegfried tells me not to fret. Could I not say the same?\"\n\n\"Different times, old friend. Now my body's a fair bit cheaper to replace than yours.\" Siegfried joked.\n\n\"Fine point, Sir.\"\n\nThe journey to the Techeuns was silent and uncomfortable. He met Petra in the cabin nose-deep in papers. Hoarse screams buried in the hard-blown fog. The Reef was shifting. She had requested his presence but informed him he would not be allowed inside the Temple. Ridiculous. Why was he here? Siegfried's thoughts were abuzz with distortion. Chaos. He followed Petra's march to the Temple chambers, the satchel of samples gripped tightly in his hand. She must have her reasons.  Her secrets. The stairways seemed endless and Siegfried could not shake the image from the cavern. That macabre ritual. He tried to think of anything else.\n\n\"Are there any other Guardians operating in this area?\" Siegfried questioned.\n\n\"Guardians come and go, but I haven't noticed anything unusual, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"Nothing you aren't telling me?\"\n\n\"I have no reason to lie to you, Titan.\"\n\n\"I saw a man.\"\n\nPetra stopped walking. The Temple door was only a few steps away. \"Is there more?\"\n\n\"He was Awoken. He bore the Spider's sigil—\"\n\n\"Where did you see this man?\"\n\n\"During your operation.\" Siegfried paused. \"He gunned down an ogre in my defense and fled.\"\n\n\"Noble for a Syndicate fly.\"\n\n\"I know you fraternize with the Spider.\" Siegfried watched her.\n\nPetra looked taken aback for a moment, then composed. \"Do you know why spiders build webs, Titan?\"\n\n\"I don't concern myself with such things.\"\n\n\"They enjoy control. Entrapment. The helplessness. Pulling strings in their small, little corners. Let them be, watched but undisturbed, and they catch other pests. Worse pests.\" Petra strode forward and placed a hand on the door. \"Maybe it's time to check his web.\" The other held out for the satchel. \"I'll look into it.\"\n\nSiegfried placed it in her hand. \"I eagerly await your findings.\"\n\n\"The Techeuns may need your account.\" Petra smirked to herself, \"I give you dominion over these stairs. Stand guard, Sir Titan. Patrol if you'd like.\"\n\nKalli, Sendia, and Shuro Chi awaited the Queen's Wrath. They placed the specimens each in a sealed containment vessel.

He didn't like the idea of relying on witchcraft, especially that which he was unable to observe. If nothing else, it could at least be faster.\n\nThe door opened behind him. Petra's face showed signs of fatigue. \"I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Return to the staging ground. I'll join you in the morning. There is still much to discuss here.\" She considered Siegfried for a moment. \"Tell the Vanguard Ikora's dream had merit. I'll be in contact.\"\n\nSiegfried sighed and stood. \"I see my account of the situation was not necessary.\"\n\nHe felt lighter now, moving down the stairs. Sharp even, as he entered the skimmer. Siegfried wasn't sure if it was the peace of an empty cabin or the security of a troop carrier escorting him. The satchel he had left with Petra. None of his concern. He removed his helmet and took a deep breath. He let his mind drift as he watched the beauty of the Strand pass. The grand gateway above him. The fabled crystalline wall standing against the fog. The wall. Atop the wall. Perched like a buzzard.\n\nIt was him.\n\nSomething hovered with him, glinting in the light.\n\n\"There he is again!\" barked Siegfried. He flung the door open and leapt without waiting for the skimmer to slow. The Titan soared through the air on Light, surging forward in an electrified dash before sliding into a full sprint.

She dodged the resulting explosions along the terrain. \"Honestly, if you want to shoot me, I'll let you! Just stop and tell me why first!\"\n\nA grenade whirled through the air in response. Piri had seen this tactic too many times to be fooled. She zipped toward the falling explosive and sheltered under a shelf of rock. The blast rattled her senses, but Piri didn't have time for them to clear. She sped through the smoking terrain, inches above the ground, knowing Lisbon would be looking for her flight to either side of the drifting cloud.\n\nAnd then in an instant, the feet of Lisbon-13 materialized in the smoke before her. She nearly ran right into him. How did he do that, she wondered, to think like others and anticipate them? She knew she needed to talk. Fast!\n\n\"Uh, okay. First thing's first. You want to destroy me. Got it. But why? What's next?\" she asked.\n\nLisbon-13 remained silent.\n\nRealization dawned. Piri bobbled in the air, shocked by her own conclusion. \"…You want the secret to die with you. No… no, no, no. You can't kill yourself. You can't! Lisbon, there has to be another way.\"\n\nLisbon-13 looked up from his Ghost and through the wafting smoke. \"She's right. This is not the way.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nLisbon-13 was not looking at his Ghost. \"It's not that the power is too terrible to wield. It's that the burden is too great to bear.\"\n\n\"Burden?\" Piri asked. The Ghost dodged as Lisbon-13 suddenly stepped forward and brushed past her.\n\nAnd stood, facing himself, once again.\n\nThe doppelganger—this other Lisbon-13—reached out and put a hand on the shoulder of the Lisbon-13 that stood a few paces behind Piri.\n\n\"You never doubted yourself. Not for a moment. The others revealed their weaknesses: their pride and self-absorption. But you remember what Rekkana said,\" it stated.\n\nLisbon-13 nodded. \"If anyone can handle the responsibility of this power—\"\n\n\"It's you,\" the doppelganger finished. \"What you fear now is not the responsibility you have assumed. It is the burden…\" the doppelganger said, glancing back at the Ghost, \"…of having all this power and never getting what you want.\"\n\nLisbon-13 had seemed distant and cold to his fireteam and his Ghost. The arguments since the Black Garden, the fighting—oh, how she had pleaded to stop the fighting! All nails in the coffin of something dead within Lisbon-13—something killed by this doppelganger in the garden's grotto. But now, some of the old Lisbon's warmth blazed white hot as he shook off his double's hand. \"You did this! You ruined everything,\" he said.\n\n\"We are all responsible for our choices. You chose this path. They chose theirs. Now is the time to select a new path. Together. We can help each other. We can free you from what you wanted. We can lighten your burden.\"\n\nPiri knew what would happen next. She braced for the explosions and readied herself to leap to Lisbon's aid.\n\nBut none came.\n\n\"…Can you make me forget her?\"\n\nLisbon-13's shadow-self embraced him. \"Yes.\"","name":"Legacy's Oath Plate","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"What is necessary and what is right are not the same.

The golden field. The looming black tower. The battle below, surging with faces that were eerily familiar. He was used to these dreams, like many of his mechanical kin, and resolutely uncurious about any deeper meaning. It couldn't be anything good, he reasoned long ago. Besides, his waking life kept him more than occupied.\n\nHowever, since his return from the kaleidoscope depths of the Infinite Forest, the dreams had increased in frequency and in eeriness. \n\nFor the first few weeks, instead of battle, he faced single opponents in duels: Osiris, Marin, Zavala, Ana—even the Guardian who rescued him from the Vex. No matter whom he fought, he would use all his energy and Light in the fight and lose every time. Flat on his back, he would look up at the tower and know that someone was watching from within. \n\nThe night before Rasputin alerted everyone of Pyramid ships entering the system, winter fell on his dreamscape, forcing him to charge through pillowy snow drifts at a massive winged Vex, unlike any he'd seen. He lost that night as he would for many more nights, watching as an iridescent liquid—almost like Vex milk, but different, contaminated—flowed from his every joint, sizzling in the snow. \n\nDuring the waking day, he maintained his usual exuberance, taking great satisfaction in helping Guardians hone their craft in the Trials of Osiris. After all, the fights happening in reality were the ones to focus on. Why worry about what he can't control inside his head?\n\nBut then, the night before a new vacuum of grief was opened in the system, a woman appeared at the threshold of the tower. Her clothes were black; her hair prematurely gray. She watched, arms crossed, as Saint hurled grenade after flaming grenade at the Vex with little effect.\n\n\"You'll blind yourself with all that bright fire,\" she tutted. \"Maybe then you'll finally learn to look instead of see.\"\n\nIn one mighty swipe, the Vex cut the Exo down. The woman sighed as Saint crumpled to the ground.\n\nSilence fell, followed by the crunching of footsteps in the snow. \"Just like your father,\" she said, kneeling by his head. \"All of you.\" \n\nShe laid a hand on the fore of his helm, as if feeling for a fever. \"In your next life, you should take more after me.\"\n\nWith that, her hand slid down to his eyes and, for the brief moment before he woke up, all was dark.","name":"Legacy's Oath Mark","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"I know who I am.

His sense of touch is good; there's certainly enough circuitry in his metal fingers to pull off the most precise of shots. But even a hair-trigger touch might rip the brittle paper… \n\nCayde pauses on a page. \"If sailor tales and sailor tunes, storm and adventure, heat and cold—\"\n\nSuddenly, a gust of surprisingly icy wind nearly rips the book from Cayde's hands. \"To hell with this godforsaken ice cube!\" he shouts, almost falling from his perch. \n\nHe steadies himself and inhales deeply. Hang on there, Cayde. You're not on any ice cube, godforsaken or otherwise.

Sailors had some kinda rhyme for it, didn't they?\n\nEither way, it hardly makes for a motivating work environment. Cayde sits on one of the crates. \"I'm taking a break,\" he announces. \"Need to or not, this is when we used to have lunch. I refuse to work through lunch.\"\n\nNext to him, Knox-4 sighs with relief and longing. \"I miss lunch. I miss getting hungry.\"\n\nCayde grins as much as his mechanical face will allow. \"Hmm…\" he intones in his best Dr. Abrams impression, \"So you would say… you're hungry for hunger?\"\n\nKnox bursts into guffaws. Cayde chuckles weakly. It wasn't that funny. But as his friend's laughter grows, so does Cayde's. Soon, they're both clutching each other and howling. \n\nThen, gradually, their cheer fades. \"What do you tell that shrink, by the way?\" Knox asks. \"You tell him about the whisper?\"\n\nCayde shakes his head. Before he can snark about the uselessness of psychologists, the whisper rings in his metal skull. It's red sky in morning, sailor's warning.

How hard can it be to find a functioning ship?!\n\nVery hard when you need said ship to make it far out of the atmosphere, even possibly all the way to the Jovians. Because while her little companions seek out their futures, Micah has her own glowing eyes set firmly on the past—on the Deep Stone Crypt. \n\nShe once thought it was hidden on Earth, buried underneath the snow drifts of Siberia, but now she suspects it's further out. In a much darker, lonelier place. Somewhere very cold, that she knows for certain. \n\nShe's dreamt of it thousands of times, fought thousands of battles on the golden field beneath the black tower. And every fiftieth instance, in the midst of the chaos, an older man puts a paternal hand on her shoulder and says, \"You just need to get acclimated. It's colder here than on Mars.\" Every hundredth time, she makes it into the tower and finds a different man sitting in an armchair, writing on a notepad. \"Dreams are messages from deep inside your mind,\" he reminds her, \"Until you figure out the message, the dream will repeat.\"\n\nEvery single time, no matter whom she sees or what she hears, Micah-10 wakes up, feeling something in her tug towards space.

In humans, bodily sensation is a form of communication, the connection between the mental and physical. But in Exos, it's all a lie. Cold, heat, hunger, exhaustion, pain—the signals aren't connected to real lack or breakage. For the most part, her body is impervious.

I was led to believe that top minds would be assembled in a collective effort to cure [REDACTED]. That was a lie. I am requesting safe passage to Earth and to be removed from the [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] has demonstrated he is incapable of empathy and will travel to the furthest reaches of our solar system to avoid legal ramifications to pursue his twisted vision. I quickly discovered his endeavor was less of a colony and more of a cult: you are either with him or against him. I was once his closest confidant. Now I hardly recognize him.\n\nHis experiments have become deranged and torturous, all while he maintains the calm lucidity of a sociopath. It is my opinion that his research and assets be frozen, so he can be retrieved and dealt a swift, unflinching justice. He is compromised and is being manipulated. To describe what I've witnessed would be a gratuitous exercise in horror, but I fear without clear circumstantial accounts, there will be no action.\n\nOne case recklessly and viciously cost a young man, [REDACTED] , the loss of his motor skills and, eventually, his life. The notion of downloading a human consciousness for preservation is not new, but an effective and nonlethal means of doing so has yet to be presented. After months of trials with brain scans that proved they were not comprehensive enough to provide more than a memory bank, [REDACTED] obsession grew. He wanted the bank to achieve [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. He was seeking the [REDACTED]. It rapidly became clear that his intentions were dubious. [REDACTED] brain was scanned beyond legal standards, and his exposure to radiation incited the accelerated growth of a tumor that impaired his cognitive function. He was moribund and should have been released from this experiment.\n\n[REDACTED] insisted this was a small hurdle, and [REDACTED] had been our most lucrative candidate, so all efforts went toward the removal of his tumor. That was when I was made aware of the milky [REDACTED] substance. He was farming the [REDACTED] that passed through the [REDACTED] he constructed under mysterious guidance for their [REDACTED]. I suspect he intends to [REDACTED], so he can close the [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] his converts to [REDACTED] directly from them. Here is the proof:\n\nWe started with injections in moderate doses under heavy surveillance. Remarkably, the tumor began to recede, and some functions were restored. He was prescribed more injections. Suddenly, he was being force-fed liters in hopes of reversing all the damage he suffered. At first we believed we stumbled onto a cure-all miracle, but soon the ramifications of our unnatural meddling reared their ugly heads. His body chemistry changed—he was overrun with new elements foreign to our periodic table. He was becoming a [REDACTED]; the [REDACTED] was [REDACTED]. The mutilation he endured as [REDACTED] replaced [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] replaced [REDACTED] was beyond the ethical code of conduct and against the moral fibers that bind us. He grew strong, violent, and incomprehensible. He was a threat to us all and was terminated after an attack where two colleagues fell victim to an outburst.\n\nThis is one case of hundreds. Past dictators have committed [REDACTED] that pale in comparison, and this was never anything more than a quest for his own ego and [REDACTED].  I fear this is only the beginning. It is a tame display compared to what [REDACTED] is capable of. It is paramount you act quickly and decisively. These experiments will lead to large-scale ruin far beyond Europa.

Hopefully a more effective plan.\n\n[silence]\n\nIR: The hostility is unnecessary, Jalaal. We are here to devise a plan.\n\nDO-AJ: We had one. It was rejected. The time for that is long past.\n\nIR: Your plan was to leave the Traveler.\n\nNM-EH: We are unprepared because we waste time debating.\n\nFWC-L2: We were prepared by every conflict that befell the City. This war has been written in the stars. Let it come.\n\nDO-AJ: Mobilize the fleet. We have guns enough. Surely, that option would please Lakshmi.\n\nFWC-L2: Yes.\n\nIR: The fire from your guns would have ricocheted off the Almighty's hull. How do you plan to wound the Pyramid?\n\nCZ: This was settled during the Red War. It has not changed.

Executor, I request the New Monarchy support us as they did so graciously when the Red Legion struck. Organize the movement of our people and coordinate with Suraya Hawthorne's contacts to secure them within the walls. Cousin Jalaal, I request Dead Orbit ships ferry the wayward home and provide transit security. In return, you will both be granted full access to the Vanguard's Luna site resources.\n\nNM-EH: A late invitation, but acceptable.\n\nDO-AJ: For the time being, we will protect caravans and aid in relocation.\n\nCZ: Good. Lakshmi, Project Stronghold will require additional printings. Ada-1 has agreed to lend her equipment and expertise to assist in this endeavor. Is this satisfactory?\n\nFWC-L2: Our forges are ready and eager. We request to assist the Bray in evaluating damage to the Warmind.\n\nCZ: Offer the help. Ana will accept it, I'm sure, so long as you defer to her oversight.\n\nFWC-L2: Her standing is tenuous.

It challenges me: Why does the Traveler strip us of our old identities?\n\nAs a Guardian, I never craved a past. Everything I cared for was in front of me. I could see my people, I could touch them, I could fight for them.\n\nBut then I lost my Ghost and the Light. Trapped in the gunpowder tunnels of the disemboweled Moon, I cursed the Traveler. It left no childhood memories to comfort me. No parents or cherished friends waiting in the City. No one to whom I could devote my return. Just Eriana, Sai, Omar, and Vell. Haunting me.\n\nOf course—I have never considered this before—there is a more generous interpretation of the Traveler's amnesia.\n\nThe Traveler believes that if we are freed of our past wounds and fears, given power and a new start, we will choose to be good. We will abandon all lesser causes to defend humanity. We will choose others over ourselves.\n\nPerhaps this is why the Traveler never speaks. Its voice is too loud to be anything but coercion. It waits, breathless, for us to make our own choice.\n\n[a small space]\n\nEnina's Ghost sent me a message. She found viable pine-apple seeds in an arcology vault.

He slipped in the cooling roux of their dead fluid.\n\nAsher swallowed a mouthful of blood and kept moving.\n\nHe paused by a whirling gate and watched the aperiodic waves, then stepped through at the only possible moment. He walked steadily through laser grids that seemed to bend around him. He hung calmly in a gravitational tourbillon as the ground beneath him flickered and shifted madly.\n\nAnd the Vex began to observe.\n\nThe corridors of the Pyramidion were lined with glowing red eyes. The metal mannequins stood dumbly, twitching, shuddering as Asher passed.\n\nA familiar area unfolded before him: a cubist sinkhole reeking with the flat, base stench of slate mud and bleach.\n\nHe looked where the sky should be and found another impossible shape; another fractal contradiction. Far above him, placid in its Penrose vortex, the vast radiolarian lake lapped gently at the metallic shores.\n\nThe man reached up to the lake with his metal arm.

She did not understand the language—not yet—but chose the green option.\n\nWith a hiss, the suit conformed to her shape. It was heavy, but she had full range of movement. She focused on her arm, concentrated, and the material scabbed into thick armored plates.

There was no pain as she felt the suit snake a cold tube through her side and coil somewhere near her stomach. That answered a few of her questions.\n\nSloane lurched outside. There was a storm, like Titan was trying to drive off the invader that sat lazily in its sky. She walked into the gale, and the rain beaded on her second skin. Each step was easier than the last as the suit adjusted to her gait.\n\nA symbol flashed, and a Hive Thrall charged her. She gripped it by its neck and arm before tearing it apart. It was so easy.\n\nShe laughed then, and the suit interpreted it as a battle cry and amplified it; broadcasted it.

But as for our enemies, two points are drilled into us from day 1: the Cabal are big, horrible brutes, and the Fallen are untrustworthy scavengers.\n\nWhat they don't tell you right away is how that is such complete garbage. \n\nI've seen Cabal who might as well have had rocks in their heads instead of brains. The kind who'll crash a tank, killing themselves, rather than stop to reload munitions in a turret. But I've known just as many Cabal who will stalk you across the Martian dunes for two days straight—no sleep, never revealing themselves. \n\nThat's how I was introduced to Bracus Dra'usk. \n\nAs for the Fallen—sorry, the Eliksni—everyone tells the story of the battle of Twilight Gap, of the Eliksni Houses sending in Dregs to eat babies and other charming bedtime stories. But nobody prepares you for an Eliksni so scared out of her wits that she tries praying to you because she thinks the \"Great Machine\" will listen through you. An Eliksni so inured in the old ways that she leaves an offering to you—like you're some sort of saint to a lesser god. \n\nThat was how I met Chirrih. \n\nA few months before the Red War, I was two days in to a long patrol on Mars tracking a limping Skyburner tank back to a carrier rendezvous location. I got sloppy. Didn't realize that the Skyburners had a rear guard because I believed the Cabal were utter morons with the tactical acumen of a boulder. Because that's what I was taught. Not that they're a proud people with a storied history. \n\nNo, I got that driven 12 inches into my abdomen when Bracus Dra'usk, leader of the Skyburner's rear guard, ran me through with a ceremonial knife. \n\nNormally that would just be a minor inconvenience, except that during the Collapse, the Darkness chewed up large reaches of Mars so bad that Light can't burn there, in the same way that fire can't burn in space. So here I am in a Darkness Zone, bleeding out, my Ghost panicking because he can't do anything to save me, and five angry Cabal ready to throw down. \n\nNow, I killed all four of Dra'usk's honor guard without needing to reload, but Dra'usk wasn't a pushover. We went a few rounds, me bleeding everywhere, him coming at me with a Sword as long as I am tall. \n\nThat's when I saw movement in my periphery, like a heat mirage. I knew what it was, but didn't have time to react until the electrostatic sheath was already coming off. But then I realized that the Eliksni Vandal coming out of cloak wasn't coming for me—it was coming for Dra'usk. \n\nYou see, what they don't teach you about Eliksni is that they're fiercely loyal when it comes to family. And Dra'usk had kidnapped and killed some of this Eliksni's kin. So here we were, two would-be enemies, taking down a Cabal Bracus like a pair of wolves. At least until I passed out from blood loss. \n\nTo my surprise, I woke up bandaged and alive. The Vandal had left a trail of scrap metal taken from Dra'usk's armor for me to follow like breadcrumbs once I was strong enough to move. My Ghost explained the Eliksni likely spared me for helping defeat a common enemy, but Ghosts aren't omniscient—they're just little nerds who read a lot. Some stuff isn't written down. \n\nAt the end of the trail outside the Darkness Zone, I found the Vandal waiting for me. She introduced herself as Chirrih. I understood her, but barely—she spoke in circular idioms interspersed with Eliksni words. She set down on the sand a trophy she'd crafted from Dra'usk's helmet: a Bow with enough draw strength to penetrate a tank at 100 yards. Then she sang at me—some kind of mandible-clicking prayer—and left. No gunfight, no bloodshed. \n\nNew Guardians tend to know two things: gun and shoot.

The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with… in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship.

She tooled the rifling in her barrels with the steady hand of an artisan. Her dyes, cobalt and ichor, shone bright as beetleshell.\n\nThe other, Gharhet, came from the distant plains. He traded for his wares and sold them dear, and thus he amassed great wealth. He embellished his goods with a rich lacquer the color of flame.\n\nWhen the Primus called for the strongest warriors to serve, the district knew the fighter Tlamus—who had broken all challengers with her keen aim and powerful frame—would represent them. Both Dhutus and Gharhet wished to outfit her with their finest pieces, as having a warrior of her status wear their colors would bring them great honor.\n\nSo Dhutus forged Tlamus a mighty war axe with an ice-blue handle and wide golden blade. Tlamus accepted the gift gladly.\n\nGharhet procured for her a Slug Rifle with bright orange plating, and Tlamus wore it proudly across her back.\n\nNext, Dhutus crafted a Shotgun, metal burnished deep as night with bright vents along the sides, and Tlamus brought it into battle.\n\nIn response, Gharhet bought a helm with thick plating and stout antlers the color of a sunset, and they were soon stained with the blood of Tlamus's foes.\n\nAnd Dhutus saw no end to this. Her shoulders ached from working the forge, and her hands were blistered by burns upon burns.\n\nSo Dhutus issued to Gharhet a challenge, and as he knew no one would raise the weapons of a coward, Gharhet accepted.\n\nThe next dawn found Dhutus on the battlefield waiting for her rival. On her shoulder was her finest weapon: a Rocket Launcher, its barrel a twisting column of seashell blue with gold trim, built as a gift for Tlamus but now wielded by its creator.\n\nFrom across the field, a figure strode forward to meet Dhutus—but it was too wide to be Gharhet; too tall, too muscular. He had bought a champion to fight in his stead.\n\nAn orange sash was draped carelessly across her chest and dragged in the dust with each confident step. Studded orange leathers bound her massive arms and thighs. Strands of coral beads hung from her tusks.\n\nShe greeted Dhutus with a fist to her chest. \"I am Tlamus,\" she said, \"chosen of Gharhet.\"\n\nDhutus could not find her voice, and then Tlamus drew one of her beautiful, terrible weapons, and the rite was soon concluded.","name":"Code Duello","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"An unfinished inscription runs along the barrel: \"Tlamus, she who—\"","hash":2496242052,"index":1617,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3075224551":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Ignovun, Chosen of the Cabal, spent all day receiving honors. After Empress Caiatl's announcement, every Legionnaire in the land tank had come to jealously salute him for his promotion. It was the appointment of a lifetime. \n\nDeep within the Halphas Electus, Ignovun oversaw his arena's preparation. There was the hanging of Caiatl's banners, the anointing of his ammunition, and the intonement of the Litany of the Chosen by an imperial mythkeeper. He was fitted for new armor that gleamed in the light. He was briefed on the protocols of the Rite, and the expectations of his victory. \n\nBut now, alone in the arena, doubt creeps into Ignovun's thoughts. Ghaul believed that the strength of the smallmen was their Light. He reasoned that the power of the Traveler, like any weapon, could be stripped from the enemy and used against them. Clearly, he was wrong. \n\nIgnovun believes differently. Their strength comes not from Light, but from death. The Guardians are already walking corpses, and yet they fight on. They have all died a thousand times, while Ignovun has yet to die even once. How can he defeat an opponent whom death cannot best? \n\nSuddenly, the treacherous ravings of Ixel, the Far-Reaching did not seem so absurd. If the Cabal are to triumph over the smallmen, they will have to succeed where Ghaul failed. They will have to bring mortality to the Vanguard. \n\nIgnovun knows that these musings will not save him.

Hear the story of the Ether-blood Lightbearer. The one who wields Ethraaks's blades. She wandered a troubled Shore with vengeance in her heart, searching for the one who had wronged her: the devil-turned-spiderling, Driksys. Food and Ether we shared. The House of Light once again found peace with a Guardian, yes?\n\nHLS: We know of Driksys. One who always thirsted for power, cursed machines, Dark flows of energy, it made no difference. This time, he sought power through Cabal; Legion-rumors of vile splinters from Europa filled his mind with temptations.\n\nHLS: Cabal roamed the Shore, battering against one another in displays of might. Like the Kells of old, they fought for the claim to supremacy… to serve Caiatl of the dead-world fleet. Driksys saw many Kells come and go. Driksys understood fragile loyalties. Understood importance of strength seen. Driksys offered Legion use of his ring for their challenges, and from Cabal blood, he drew profit.\n\nHLS: I stood with Driksys before the House of Light. This one saw him weave truthless words to collect promises. Contacts on Europa. Introductions. Shipments. Brought to Spider, entire ring would have died… many Eliksni lose. When the Ether-blood Lightbearer spoke Driksys's name, we imagined another way forward. She did not wish harm on innocent Eliksni, only the Fallen fiend: Driksys… and so this House granted shimmer-cloak to conceal, and passage to find her prey.\n\nHLS: Old friends traded for information, access, codes. Driksys oversaw new ring, made for Cabal battle-trials. Challengers from across the Reef fought to lead the Shore's Cabal. The Lightbearer withheld her rage and made her way beneath the stands. To the overlook, where Driksys watched a champion preparing for challengers… in the ring below.\n\nHLS: Trihn, the Lightbearer, drew blades of Ethraaks and burst into the overlook. To confront Driksys, her heart full with vengeance, her mind set on war. But he was not alone. An emissary of the new empress had come to see the challenges. Receiving this emissary, Cabal Blood Guard. The Lightbearer charged Driksys, and a savage battle ensued.\n\nHLS: She was thrown from the overlook, into the ring of challengers… before a great Cabal Gladiator who spoke to her. The Lightbearer, unbeknownst to her, had issued a challenge by entering his ring. If she did not fight, all Cabal would descend upon her. Her victory must be earned with strength and blade alone. No other weapons. No other powers. A proving she accepted to again clear a path to her prey.\n\nHLS: The Gladiator bellowed laughter at the small Awoken Lightbearer. Their blades met, and over many clashes her speed proved superior to the Cabal's might. The blades of Ethraaks are strong—sliced through Cabal armor, left blood and oil in their wake.\n\nHLS: She had found victory, but as her Ghost tended to her wounds, Driksys-coward fled to safety through transmat. Though, all was not lost. The Lightbearer's battle had drawn eyes of the emissary, who lavished praise on her for her prowess, and issued an invitation to speak with Cabal Empress herself. When the Lightbearer returns to us, the House of Light will be ready to assist her in hunting Driksys again.","name":"Shadow Price","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"A precision Auto Rifle left behind by Toland, the Shattered.

They remembered Amtec's words. They remembered the brief hope the Sundial had shown them, and they remembered the name trailed in curses and woe. Although she and her sisters could not hope to destroy a city, they could kill the man who commanded it.\n\nShe refocused her eye on the Guardian as it loaded a new cylinder into a crude metal cannon.

A Cabal advance threatens to encircle a defensive line held by crimson frames and one lone Light.\n\nShaw Han dips his head beneath a swivel of Machine Gun rounds and dives for the trench line. He slams his back against an earthen wall next to a few shot-to-pieces Redjacks. His eyes focus on the gaping bullet holes perforating their thin plating as he runs a shaky hand over his own chest. At least they were just frames. He had bled out from open wounds before and was in no rush to relive the experience. Shaw peers down to the end of his trench where a detachment of Gladiators crash through their flanks. \"Just a little farther…\"\n\nA Solar explosion vaporizes the leading Gladiator and scatters their charge. A surviving Cabal recoils from the explosion in confusion. He stumbles backward into another of Shaw's trip mines and obliterates the rest of his comrades in a chain of explosions. Shaw exhales the tension in his chest and makes a mental note of the frames lost in the blast. He could take a verbal lashing from Shaxx if it meant no more blood on his hands.\n\nHe glances back to the flank. Through the settling dust of a crisis averted, Shaw sees faint silhouettes of a second Cabal charge incoming.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Commander Zavala had tasked him with holding this sector. Had called him by name directly, imbued Shaw with his trust. He couldn't go back having lost a fertile ground for new Lights. Old Russia was his to protect, and no Cabal conqueror would claim it while he still drew breath.\n\n Slugs slap hard into the earthen trench wall at his back, sending reverberations through his ribs. He shifts to plot a safe path to defend the flank. Shaw readies to move as a heavy metal boot slams out of transmat in front of him, followed by a solid Light barricade erected to deflect the incoming metallurgic hail.\n\n\"Get up, Han. That ditch isn't going to save you.\" Machine Gun fire thunders off the barricade as Lord Saladin grabs him and raises Shaw to his feet. \"That's for your Light to do.\"\n\n\"Saladin?\" Shaw closes his mouth and tries again. \"Lord Saladin.\"\n\n\"Zavala forwarded your support request.\" Saladin ignores Shaw's surprised expression and eyes the Cabal fortifications. \"You're with me now.\"\n\n\"Sir.\" Shaw nods with a steady confidence. \"What's the plan?\"\n\nSaladin peers through the cracking barricade, slugs crashing finger-lengths from his face. \"Holliday is en route to deploy our heavy ordnance, but she needs their attention off the skies.\" Saladin looks at him for the first time and smiles. \"Take out their flak guns, and give them no choice but to focus those Machine Gun nests on us.\"\n\n\"Oh…\" Shaw wasn't sure if he'd call this a plan—maybe a Titan plan.\n\n\"You're fast on your feet, son. You'll be fine.\" Saladin motions the advance; \"JACKS, SUPPRESSING FIRE!\"\n\nLord Saladin strides into the no-man's-land surrounded by advancing Redjacks and a billowing aura of searing refraction. He hurls a fusion grenade across the expanse without breaking pace and demolishes one of the dozens of machinegun nests outright. Shaw moves behind him. Flame licks down the Ahamkara spine lashed to his arm until it meets the hammer of his weapon and ignites his Golden Gun. He singles out several enemy flak cannons and skewers them with Solar points, incinerating nearby Cabal.\n\nHot barrels realign on the Guardians as a magnificent flare emblazons Lord Saladin's armor in Solar Light. From his palms erupts a mighty maul that clinks into his gauntlets. Heavy slugs clang as they shrug off his immolated plate. He does not flinch or falter. Saladin charges the line, heat intensifying and melting slugs into slag droplets that ping and sizzle against him. He slams his maul into the dirt, driving a sweeping inferno toward the Cabal gunline. It hits like a bursting artillery shell, catching oil alight and spreading hot panic through the Cabal ranks.\n\nShaw dodges around incoming fire and reloads his weapon. He snaps off two more golden rays into the remaining enemy flak cannons. Frames push forward alongside them, absorbing slugs for the Guardians and keeping pressure on the gunline. Shaw spots several Gladiator detachments redirecting to confront them. He pushes the bulk of his Light into his weapon, spreads its influence to reach the nearby Redjacks, and reignites his gun before touching the barrel to the ground and firing. The ground bubbles with hot magmatic Light; a warmth envelops the Redjacks as Solar flame imbues and empowers their rifles with golden power. Shaw directs the firestorm of golden Redjack rifles to incinerate every last charging foe.\n\nSaladin bears down on the Cabal, almost in their ranks now. He is a wildfire of Light and death. Legionaries flee their nests rather than challenge him. Frantic Cabal radio transmissions crackle across the battleground. All remaining guns turn to stop the Iron Lord's advance, but only succeed in slowing it.

She was perhaps the most diligent of the Hidden, having dedicated herself to the unpleasant task of hunting down tainted Guardians. But that was precisely what worried Ikora. Each time they met, she seemed a little gaunter than before. A little testier. Was this crusade beginning to take a toll? Was it a mistake to give her another assignment instead of a vacation? \n\n\"I stand by my promise,\" Aunor snapped before transmatting out. \n\nThat had not alleviated Ikora's concerns one iota . She let out a sigh and rubbed her temples. \n\nShe couldn't dwell on it for long, however. The air crackled again. When Ikora opened her eyes, Saint was standing exactly where Aunor had been, moments ago. \"Ikora Rey, I am sorry to come unannou—\"\n\n\"How did you get in here?\" she blurted. No one but the Hidden knew where her private library was. Or so she had thought. \n\nThe Exo stared at her, confused. \"I—I transmatted,\" he said simply.

A gentle breeze rolled through the streets, ruffling treetops and bearing choirs of cicadas. On a night like this, even the most chronic of insomniacs could achieve a sound, dreamless sleep—all they'd need do was lay their head down and breathe deep. \n\nExcept for Zavala. He preferred to spend a night like this walking through the gardens.  \"Nothing better than a midnight stroll. Right, Targe ?\" he remarked quietly to the Ghost floating over his shoulder. \n\nTarge bobbed silently in the breeze. In his opinion, a full eight hours of sleep would've been vastly better, especially for the beleaguered commander. But, while some Ghosts felt giving advice was part of their calling, he did not. So he said nothing. \n\nHis disapproval was felt regardless. \"I know, I should rest.\" Zavala closed his eyes and inhaled. The night air was fragrant with fresh blooms and petrichor. \"But I'd argue this counts.\" \n\nTarge remembered when this acre was first dug out for planting, back when the City was little more than a sprawl of encampments. They had just returned from a grueling patrol, but as soon as Zavala saw the others digging, he dropped his weapons and picked up a shovel. \n\nSaladin gave him a long lecture about the importance of rest and recovery, but he just stubbornly kept on digging. \"I'd like to sow some life for once,\" he said. Targe could still picture the look on the Iron Lord's face in that moment, flickering between pride and exasperation. It was in that moment that he, too, picked up a shovel. \n\n\"We've come so far,\" Zavala murmured in the present. \"Sacrificed so much.\" \n\nAgain, Targe said nothing. They had indeed. As they passed under a tree, the cicadas tucked in its branches went still. For a few seconds, the only noise was the crunch of boots on the gravel path. Once Zavala and Targe were a few yards away, the cicadas resumed their melodic thrumming. \n\n\"It amazes me sometimes that I've survived this long.\" Zavala looked up, his pupils reflecting the bone-white orb of the Traveler above. \"All thanks to you.\" His words came out so soft, and it was hard to tell if they were an accusation or gratitude. \n\nTarge tilted up towards the Traveler too. What could he say? It was his duty to resurrect his Guardian. More than that, it was his purpose. Not one he had chosen, but then again, neither had Zavala. \n\nA silence fell, deeper than before. Ghost and Guardian stared up at the opaque moon, their thoughts synchronized around the same question: \n\n\"Are you watching over us? Or are we on our own?\"","name":"Eternal Blazon","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"But this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood.\"","hash":3514096004,"index":1632,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2481881293":{"displayProperties":{"description":"All was quiet in the Gulch, save for the occasional chirp of birds and the gentle trickle of the river. It might've been peaceful, Chalco Yong thought as she crept along the bank, if it wasn't so damn eerie. Where were the Cabal and their noisome injection rigs? Where were the thundering Pike gangs? Evidently taking the day off, just when it was most inconvenient.\n\nThe Hidden agent crouched, running her hand over the smooth stones cluttering the shore. She was hoping to have good news for her next report. Ikora looked so tired at their last check-in.\n\nNo wonder. Even before the Pyramids arrived, it felt like their enemies were multiplying at the same rate their allies were decreasing. Now, with four celestial bodies stolen out of the sky, that trend seemed to be accelerating.\n\nAnd here she was, following a tenuous lead on the whereabouts of the infamous Light Kell into a dead zone.\n\nShe briefly considered turning her radio on and checking in, but then she saw it: the ideal skipping stone, palm shaped and perfectly worn. She picked it up, and with a well-timed flick, sent it spinning across the water. The mirror image of blue sky and pine tree tops rippled once, twice, six times before gravity outweighed momentum, pulling the stone beneath the surface.\n\nSuddenly, a frenetic rustling broke out all around her. The trees quivered as hundreds of birds burst forth, shrieking in alarm as they circled in the sky. Chalco whipped around, rifle at the ready, but there was no one. She slowed her breathing, ears open for the telltale whine of speeding Pikes.\n\nThe wispy hairs on the back of her neck stood at attention as the air crackled with electricity. A great rumbling threw Chalco off her feet. She rolled as she hit the ground. The second shockwave arrived while she was facedown—a louder and more definitive thud that caused the rocks to jump up and fall back down with a clatter.\n\nSilence returned. When she lifted her head, all seemed as it had moments ago…\n\n…except for the once-clear sky, now streaked with aurorae of many colors.\n\nChalco leapt up and ran for the ravine wall. She scaled it, then the nearest pine in a matter of seconds. A risky move considering the possibility of aftershock, but she needed height.\n\nIt wasn't until she reached the wavery top branches that she saw it. Cresting over the tree line was the Shard of the Traveler, bleeding polychrome rays. Chalco turned her gaze up, following the arc into the stratosphere. What was happening?\n\nKeeping her eyes fixed on the sky, she flipped on her radio. Immediately, Eris Morn's voice echoed over the Vanguard's public frequency: \"This will not be the end. It will be an escalation.\"\n\nA flash, piercing in its brilliance, lit up the southeastern sky. Chalco braced herself against the tree, squeezing her eyes shut. When she opened them, the sky had returned to clear blue and the Shard had returned to its dim, jagged state.\n\n\"Huh,\" she said aloud to no one.","name":"Cartesian Coordinate","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"Where does one end and the other begin?","hash":2481881293,"index":1633,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3335343363":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"You can't be serious, Arrha.

The faint sounds of revelry drifted in from down the hall, where the other Associates were enjoying their week's earnings. \n\n\"Avrok already told me about Crow's new assignment as Vanguard agent. Apparently, he's placed quite the wager on one of the Cabal's silly Rites ,\" the Spider chuckled. \"Avrok should've dared him to bet his freedom.

Out of corner of his eye, he could see his share of Ether waiting in the corner. \n\n\"Oh, take your wages and go.

I enter the belly of the Leviathan, unattended. My eyes catch on the runs in Calus's crestfallen banners. His inner halls don't gleam—reminds me of stories from the Golden Age. Polish the veneer and present them on a platter, but when you peel back the layers it's just… old. Past, with prime far behind.\n\nAhead, a Legionary in loyalist gild nods to me and swings open a door. A manufactured version of Calus stands tall on the other side. Its likeness mirrors the Tribute Hall's automaton and many other statuesque bots I'd spoken to him through.\n\nThe statue of Calus whines to life. \"You're early, but I suppose your tribe is always ahead of the pack, Hunter. Should I have this room moved, that you may stroll the Leviathan's halls that much longer and appreciate my hospitality?\"\n\nI'm not sure what he wants to hear. \"She's an impressive beast. I've come to take the job.\" I turn it like an offer.\n\nUncomfortable silence.\n\n\"Come and see me, Katabasis. I have a gift for you.\"\n\nThe statue points toward a domed chamber; its curled walls sport every kind of trophy. Bones on hooks. Taxidermy wrapped around terrified eyes and final moments.\n\nA clutch of Councilors watches me as they take mechanical plates from three other identical statues of Calus surrounding them. They huddle about a towering cage of filigreed alloys and woven circuitry, fitting the plates to it with sacramental focus, until the cage becomes a tomb around a pearlescent seat supporting a lonesome figure within.\n\n\"What an auspicious early arrival. Come. Witness my containment. Few have seen this,\" Calus wheezes from inside the cage, his voice like taut suffocation.\n\nCalus's withering form swells and jostles. My thoughts stink of disgust, and he can smell it. \"I am no more trapped here than you are by your Light. You assume this flesh satisfies me? How small. My automatons stand as monuments of my image; reflections of my breadth. They are, as I am: one collective self, as Nothing is.\n\nI grit my teeth and look on, stepping sideways to see him from a different angle. His skin is mottled with sickly translucence that grips my stomach.\n\n\"Your thoughts are as open as your fears, Katabasis. Come, come…  look upon me and let my Councilors assuage them.\"\n\nCouncilors lay more thick plates over Calus's living misery, brushing past me as they finish and exiting the room with my inhibitions. Mechanisms within the plates engage as plum light emits from the slits between them. Nacre runs smooth around the frame and into a throne-like cup of sullied nobility. Beneath the throne, hoses bubble viscous royal wine into the sealed frame. Calus looks through me, eyes like clumped chalk, as the last Councilor fastens a faceplate into position. Deep orbs illuminate in the faceplate, like wild eyes in the open pitch of night. We are alone.\n\n\"What do you know of lies, Katabasis?\"\n\nI pick between the words. \"There're a lot different kinds.\"\n\n\"And all of them are weakness. \" Calus's voice spills from the containment vessel and floods the room. \"Gods do not lie. Like me, they have neither the capacity nor the reason. True power cannot be threatened. It does not compel deception. And yet, I have been betrayed by one I thought to be the final divinity.\"\n\n\"Sounds like you got swindled… ?\" I quickly blunt the question with respect: \"…Emperor?\"\n\n\"When the Darkness found me adrift in the cosmos, rejected by a people I had made, I thought to have found a confidant. No—an idol. They promised to return to me, to uplift me—that we may dance together among the stars and drink of their dying ecstasy 'til the end, as one. But their chilling little fleet came and went. It was luscious, and so many tasted so much. Yet I am empty. Nothing.

Calus's words ring in my ears over the storm-rush of reentry: \"The ship is yours to claim.\"\n\nMost of the seats in the drop-hold are empty. A Psion officer named Qinziq sits across from me. Her eye hasn't left me since she boarded. To my right, a craggy Cabal Centurion, complete with demolition satchels and Projection Rifle, adjusts the connectors on his pressure suit. He'd been assigned to make sure none of the other Cabal try to kill me. Seems news of my command had rendered a number of the crew indignant.\n\nI prod first: \"I can't imagine hiding a ship from the Legion was easy on Nessus. To be honest, I'm surprised they haven't tried to storm the Leviathan.\"\n\n\"They would die,\" grumbles the Centurion. \"Bad strategy.\"\n\n\"What does it matter? Calus saw fit to give you a ship, Katabasis.\" My Ghost, Gilgamesh, glares at me.\n\nQinziq sneers and leans forward. Her voice seethes from her helmet. \"The Legion is stirred by Caiatl's rousing, Human…\" I recognize the tinge of malice in her address. \"…and the fall of Torobatl. She sends heralds of her fleet. Ships come and go without stories recorded. We pass unnoticed for some time.\"\n\nThe brute bows his head.\n\n\"First I'm hearing of it. You're saying they won't notice this ship taking off?\" I ask.\n\n\"For some time,\" Gilly quotes the Psion.\n\n\"But normally they would… because it's a Legion ship, and you've set me up to commit thievery?\"\n\n\"All Cabal ships belong to Calus,\" the Centurion growls. \"And Qinziq does not answer to you.\"\n\n\"Right.\" My shoulders slump forward, head resting in my hands, as the Thresher touches down. We disembark onto prickly milk-rich soil, turning away from the sun as the deep green sky slowly bleeds out. A congested Cabal shipyard glows in the distance against the crest of dark riding the horizon.\n\n\"You are Katabasis.\" The Cabal is speaking to me. He gestures to himself. \"Bahr'Toran.\"\n\n\"You're my skull-cracker.\" I point to my Ghost. \"Name's Gilgamesh, or Gilly.\"\n\nBahr'Toran considers for a moment and nods. \"I do that.

I think the plan is more a quiet reappropriation of goods, Bahto.\"\n\n\"I do not like that.\"\n\n\"Gilly's didn't take at first, but time wears ya down.\"\n\nGilly nods to Bahto, who nods back with a grunt and begins walking. We follow him across the bluffs toward the yard, into flatland desolace and sunless gloom.\n\nThe shipyard is a massive pulverized flat of rough tarmac and shanty barracks surrounded by a barrier fence. It overflows with craft ranging across eras of the Cabal Empire. On the far end of the strip, Gilly spots Arc-lights shining. A figure draped in azure raiment stands above a throng of Cabal, drawing attention like thunder. Whatever he's saying, they believe it. Gilly catches a few words. It's the same talk you hear anywhere else someone's been forgotten: blame, looking for a hole to fester in; wrestling at the edges with tepid hope; at risk of falling back down into the past.\n\n\nFRENETIC SCRAWL INKED IN THE MARGIN READS: Maintenance hall off the cargo bay door.

Qinziq points to it, a Cabal carrier-class warship. \"Glykon Volatus.\" She touches her finger to the yard's perimeter barrier and says, \"Over,\" as if directing an animal. Qinziq flattens her palm against the ground and displaces the radiolarian saturation with a bubble of Void energy. It bursts and launches her and Bahto over the barrier. I follow on steps of Light, my Tex Mechanica rifle dangling from a loose strap.\n\nBahto settles last on uneasy jet bursts. Qinziq steps in front of him and calibrates a device on his chest plate before Bahto turns to face me. \"One of your transmat,\" he grumbles. \"I will stop their signal receiver, so our ship is hidden until we remove its locational anchor.\"\n\nWe separate into the silent yard, to our tasks. Qinziq and I weave through a field of parked interceptors as Bahto does his best to stay inconspicuous on his way to a gargantuan signal dish at the adjacent edge of the yard.\n\nThe daunting bow of the Glykon Volatus looms, obstructing the sky like a bloodied wave rearing up to consume us. I duck behind the frontal landing gear while Qinziq opens a service chute to the command deck.\n\nI peek through the open hatch. Down the hall, a lone Psion runs diagnostics on the bridge. I carefully crawl inside and slip the long rifle from my back.\n\n\"Shoot it.\"\n\n\"Guns are loud, Gil.\" He wasn't totally off-kilter. One thought from that Psions could alert the whole yard.\n\n'Ignorance.' The word ripples through my brain in Qinziq's seething voice. 'She will not.'\n\nI didn't invite you in here, I thought.\n\nThe ripple spreads: 'Yours is a mind unfocused and taxed. Chaos where reason should lie.'\n\n\"We need this ship,\" Gilly whispers. He swings into my peripheral view. \"If you don't do something, that Psion is going to have every Cabal in the sector on us!\"\n\nQinziq surfaces from the hatch and kneels beside us. \"This is Yirix, Ghost. She will not reveal us.\"\n\n\"She's Red Legion. Calus would see her executed.\"\n\n\"Psions fly many colors, but within the Cabal, we exist in congress, moving toward our own future. She will recognize my contribution, as I hers,\" Qinziq says, stepping forward.\n\nGilly watches Qinziq approach the other Psion. \"If this sours, don't give it the chance.\"\n\nHis words cinch around my lungs. Short breaths of wary anticipation escape. I sight my long gun and wait.\n\nYirix stiffens as she becomes aware of Qinziq. She turns. They bow their heads together. The two empathize and come to one understanding in silence.\n\nWhatever ambitions they have go further than this ship, this moment, this Cabal. I hadn't thought that way since I last wore the veneer of a Guardian. Sold a dream of an immortal City shielded by Light, as if it could go on forever. Forever is just a hope folks don't live long enough to see crumble.\n\nYirix looks to Gilly and me, to my rifle, unthreatened. I feel her request for temperance and a tranquil reassurance of their cause. For a moment, I feel young.

He manages a few prideful words, \"Charges set. We will not be tracked.\"\n\nThe Glykon breaks atmosphere as a colossal explosion rocks the shipyard and shutters through our hull.

Gilly and I stand above a host of chattering carcasses. Plugs can cables run from them into the flesh of an Ether-logged Scorn beneath an ugly crown.

Incendiors step forward to cremate the remains between volleys. I add my gun to line, dropping Raiders before they can align shots on our ring and slinging Voidwall grenades to stem the flood. Qinziq screams, straining to sever the link as the Glykon thrashes against Dark waves. Black fire scalds her hands as Nothing twists around us. We fight until the floor is lined with dead Scorn and empty magazines.\n\nThe shrieking recedes. Scraping metal echoes through the viewing chambers as a wave of Darkness tremors through the Glykon. Every unburnt Scorn seizes and begins to reconstitute.

Panic, pain, darkness. Realistic consequences for failure. The chamber left its inhabitants floating in a void after defeat—and in that emptiness, minutes could feel like hours. \n\nWhen the darkness finally evaporated, Caiatl stood in the blank chamber. Alone. \n\nUmun emerged and crossed the room. \"You're dead,\" she told her. \n\nCaiatl kept her back straight and voice level, though there was a tremor in her arm—a humiliating aftereffect. \"Yes.\" \n\n\"You were distracted,\" Umun said. \"I saw you: looking around, like you were on a sightseeing flight.\" She made a dismissive gesture with her left hand. \"Weaned and coddled on too many stories.\"\n\n\"I won't fail again,\" Caiatl said. \n\n\"Wrong,\" said Umun'arath. \"You will die many more times if you wish to live.\" She clapped a hand on Caiatl's shoulder. \"Do it again.\"","name":"CHAPTER 2: STAR PILOT","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/07560f40ed68d7af80a9f280de20ef1e.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1840646926,"index":1648,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1840646927":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Caiatl felt the assassin's eyes on her back before she heard their words. \n\n\"Your father sends his regards,\" they croaked. \n\nShe calmly turned.

They reminded him of the tiny red beetles that crawled around in the dust where he'd come up; the ones that swarmed war beast pens and crept into woven clothes. The best way to get rid of them, his mother taught him, was to hold a flame close to the seams of their shells. They snapped and popped in the heat.\n\nHe found the same to be true for the Hive. \n\nBy now, he'd stopped expecting anyone to come for him. Their invasion had become a death sentence; one he had accepted by the nature of his position. He would die for the Legion, with or without the promise of reward. \n\nAs Val Ma'rag listened to a transmission from the Empress Caiatl, he thought about how far he'd come since he was recruited. Since he was pulled out of the poorest rural district on his planet. With this new challenge—with the new empress sending her call out into the system—he could go a lot farther. \n\n///\n\nEuropa was cold. Basilius  was no stranger to cold—he'd been stationed on Mars before it disappeared, before his Valus  sent him and his reports off-planet on a recon mission. He didn't care for intel  or resource gathering, but a Valus is law. Or at least, he was. \n\nAfter a false start  on Nessus, they'd brought the cruiser to Europa. The icy moon was crawling with thieving Fallen, but there were secrets buried in the ice. Dainty Human technology. It didn't interest him, but the Psions loved to tinker, and they insisted there was something here worthwhile. \n\nSomething that could catch the attention of an empress hoping to regain favor with her scattered people. Something that might win a soldier like him, with no valuable titles or reputation to his name, a new level of recognition. \n\nAnd the respect he deserved. \n\n///\n\nAs the voice of their so-called empress droned on from a beat-up radio, the soldiers ate. Commander Dracus picked at the bones of a roasted bird, gun laid across his lap. The little red-violet winged creatures on Nessus didn't have much meat on them, but they were challenging and satisfying to trap. \n\n\"What's she mean, 'ancient rites'?\" a young Legionary asked. \n\nThe commander looked up. \n\n\"Old-timer traditions?\" she went on. \n\nDracus snorted. \"An honored tradition,\" he said. \"Beloved by the Praetorate . Warriors take on challengers to prove their battle-worth.\" He eyed her. \"Calves like you wouldn't remember that.\" \n\n\"Is it open to anyone?\" the Legionary asked. \n\nHe laughed. \n\n\"Well,\" she growled. \"Are you taking challengers?\" She squared her weight. \"You can start with me.\" \n\nDracus looked the bold youngling up and down, calculating the effort. He had no great desire to impress the disgraced emperor's pampered daughter. The leader he knew and served was the dominus , dead or alive. But maybe there was money to be gained from this. He wouldn't turn his nose up at the prospect. \n\nHe tossed the bird bones aside, lifted his gun, and fired a shot right into the Legionary's belly. She fell. \n\n\"I win,\" he said. \n\n///\n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because she'd risen far above her station in a fraction of her lifetime. \n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because she pulled things from her mind that should be out of reach from memory. \n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because she grasped for everything she could not have. \n\nIt was all true. On the strange terrain of the Nessus centaur, Ixel had extracted herself from command. The Valus had been uncreative, small minded. He hadn't seen the value in the Vex technologies that might amplify Ixel's unique Psionic talents. So she killed him and poached the unit's best fighters. \n\nHard to say if this competition was open to traitors of the empire. \n\nAnd yet somehow, this new empress, foolish though she was, might be inspired by bold action. \n\nNot to mention the things Ixel could pull from the prediction engines. Intelligence beyond the empress's imagining. \n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because her ambition was limitless.","name":"I.

From this one, she learned two things: First, that warriors were not game pieces, no matter how much her generals enjoyed bickering over war tables. And second, that a society of warriors could not hope to beat a god of war at her own game, and by her own rules. \n\nThere were shades of victory. Escaping their homeworld with so many survivors was a victory. Regaining their army was a victory. Avoiding an all-out war with the Guardians would be another. \n\nExcept the Guardians would not negotiate. \n\nShe hadn't expected it. She'd thought that after Ghaul's attack, they would do anything to avoid another war.

The last thing Crow wanted was for the Titan to spot the binoculars' reflection. \n\nIt had been like this for the past week.

Living for hundreds of years didn't endow you with deep understanding of another person, it turned out. Close and steady partnership did. She knew him by now. He held his fears close to his chest, protecting the people he cared about. But with time, with patience, he would let her see. Sometimes. So she waited. \n\n\"I keep seeing his face,\" Zavala murmured after a long silence. \n\nIkora looked at him, her expression falling. When she spoke, her voice was soft with grief. \"Cayde?\" \n\n\"No,\" Zavala said. He gripped the railing with both hands, a gesture of frustration and self-doubt. \"Uldren Sov.\" \n\nIkora straightened, surprised. That sharp feeling of being caught off guard , of realizing you'd missed something, froze her for a moment. \n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked cautiously. \n\n\"In the Tower,\" Zavala said. \"In crowds…\" He hesitated. \"I saw him… in the gardens.

Waiting for him to ask. \n\n\"I don't know why my mind goes to folk stories.

And in the face of a superior military force, you did what you had to do to survive. There's no shame in that.\" \n\nThe Psion flared their moist facial flaps and fixed their lone eye on the Iron Lord . Saladin wondered whether they were glaring in defiance, or struggling to breathe without their helmet. He marveled at their repulsiveness. \n\n\"But even after Calus fled, and Ghaul was defeated, you still grovel before tyrants like Caiatl. If you rose up, you could taste true independence instead of the patronizing scraps that she offers .\" Saladin shook his head in contempt. \"Your power is wasted by cowardice.\" \n\nIn the silence that followed, the Iron Lord noticed a curious change in the surrounding atmosphere. The air filled with a sharp frequency—not a sound, but a high-intensity vibration that seemed to emanate from inside his own head, like a blossoming migraine . \n\nOsiris chuckled. \"Our friend disagrees.\" \n\nSaladin snarled and grabbed the Psion by their shackled wrists. He dragged his prisoner to the edge of the wall and held them over the precipice. He was amazed at how light they were without armor, like a scrawny little bird. \n\nOsiris sniffed in distaste and looked back toward the Last City. He doubted Saladin's ham-fisted  style of interrogation would work, but the Psion had resisted his own subtler approach. \n\n\"Where did they get the Light-dampening tech ? How did they modify the prediction engines ?\" Saladin snapped. The Iron Lord held firm as the Psion struggled weakly in his grip. \"Where are they? Where's the rest of the cell ?\" \n\nThe Psion's lone eye  fluttered wildly, and Saladin felt a sudden rush of vertigo, as if he was the one with the hundred-meter drop beneath him. The Titan steeled  himself. \n\n\"We will find them eventually. You can't control that. The only thing you can control now is your own survival. Tell us where they are.\" \n\nThe Psion began to tremble, like an animal shivering in the cold. But they said nothing. Instead, they assaulted the Iron Lord with another wave of vertigo. \n\nThe wall felt as if it were flexing and tilting beneath the Titan. He growled through clenched teeth. \"Last chance: where are they?\" \n\nSuddenly, Osiris was at Saladin's side. The vertigo broke. \"Lord Saladin,\" he urged. \"This is a waste of time. You of all people should recognize unrelenting stubbornness when you see it.\" \n\n\"You're right.\" Saladin regarded the Psion with quiet admiration. \"If the roles were reversed, I'd rather die than betray my loyalty.\" \n\nThe Iron Lord gave the Psion a nod of respect, and then effortlessly hefted them over the edge. \n\nIn the split second before gravity took hold, Lord Saladin met the Psion's gaze. He suddenly saw himself reflected in the creature's Y-shaped pupil: a ferocious ogre in metal armor, filled with violence. A dull primate, infused with godlike power. A fragile mind cursed with immortality. \n\nSaladin felt the creature's terror. But he also felt the expanse of the Psion's ancestors yawn forth  beneath him. He felt their hands reach up to embrace him in a comforting void. He heard the ringing chorus of their timeless harmony call to him.

Any memento of their culture, no matter how trivial, was invaluable. \n\nHaving lost the Red Legion, their dominus , and their homeworld, Caiatl's people needed tradition to galvanize them. They needed the touchstones  of their past to carry them into the terrifying future. They needed to feel like they were still Cabal. \n\nCaiatl considered the throne in context of the decision before her. The leader of the Vanguard had offered to settle their dispute with a Rite of Proving . It would preempt an exhausting war of attrition with a single, decisive engagement. An exceedingly clever tactic she had not considered. \n\nThe Rite of Proving was once a simple trial-by-combat, used to settle disputes between neighbors.

The soldier had been gazing solemnly out a porthole when the sound of her voice startled him. He turned suddenly, then winced in pain. Caiatl saw darkened synthetic fabric enveloping his torso and the entirety of his right arm, which itself looked frail and withered. She knew immediately that this Cabal would see no more battles.\n\n\"My empress!\" the warrior responded, clasping a fist to his chest with his unwrapped arm. Caiatl saluted in return.\n\nThe empress glanced at a monitor displaying the patient's data. \"Val'ast, born of Val'tui.\" She looked out the porthole; the brilliance of Sol beamed back at her. \"The empire has returned for you, Red Legionary, yet your heart seems heavy. Why do you languish?\"\n\nVal'ast looked away. \"I am sorry, Empress.\"\n\n\"Do not be sorry, my brother,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast sighed. \"For years, every day has been about survival.

They thought battle could be avoided. But the third warrior died with pride and honor.\"\n\nVal'ast pondered for a moment. \"Even in defeat, she left her mark on her foe.\"\n\nCaiatl nodded. \"And the next time one of her kin faced it, the beast would be one blow closer to death.\"\n\n\"Did more come?\" Val'ast questioned.\n\n\"Of course!\" Caiatl exclaimed. \"They were Cabal, and the sun was theirs to claim.

The soldier had been gazing solemnly out a porthole when the sound of her voice startled him. He turned suddenly, then winced in pain. Caiatl saw darkened synthetic fabric enveloping his torso and the entirety of his right arm, which itself looked frail and withered. She knew immediately that this Cabal would see no more battles.\n\n\"My empress!\" the warrior responded, clasping a fist to his chest with his unwrapped arm. Caiatl saluted in return.\n\nThe empress glanced at a monitor displaying the patient's data. \"Val'ast, born of Val'tui.\" She looked out the porthole; the brilliance of Sol beamed back at her. \"The empire has returned for you, Red Legionary, yet your heart seems heavy. Why do you languish?\"\n\nVal'ast looked away. \"I am sorry, Empress.\"\n\n\"Do not be sorry, my brother,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast sighed. \"For years, every day has been about survival.

They thought battle could be avoided. But the third warrior died with pride and honor.\"\n\nVal'ast pondered for a moment. \"Even in defeat, she left her mark on her foe.\"\n\nCaiatl nodded. \"And the next time one of her kin faced it, the beast would be one blow closer to death.\"\n\n\"Did more come?\" Val'ast questioned.\n\n\"Of course!\" Caiatl exclaimed. \"They were Cabal, and the sun was theirs to claim.

Reed-7 finds comfort in the banality of human conversation when viewed at a macro level—the impression of life. It's something other than language to him, something he imagines the universe might sound like to a Warlock. At least, he assumes they hear those things. \n\nThere is relief that in this moment,  Reed hears only the people in the Bazaar, not the voices of horror that haunt him from Io's cradle. When he thinks too hard about it, he can still hear the Darkness moaning through his Ghost. Rather than dwell on it, he searches for something else to fixate on, something to distract him. \n\nThe whole of the Bazaar is decorated for the Festival of the Lost, with colorful engram-shaped ornaments hung from decoratively macabre trees. A Ghost—one he's fairly certain belongs to the Warlock Osiris—goes cartwheeling by with a shriek of laughter, trailing cloth wrappings in her wake. The moment of levity helps lift Reed's spirits as he returns to his table in New Monarchy's enclosure where Aisha and Shayura wait for him. \n\n\"Drinks,\" Reed says, setting down three tall mugs wafting with steam.

Shayura has the wherewithal to give him a distracted thumbs-up. It's at least comforting, if not wholly reassuring. Aisha gives Reed a wordless look of concern and shakes her head. Their talk had not gone well while he was away. \n\n\"I know you're upset about Sloane,\" Reed says, deciding to tear off that conversational bandage. \"But you know the commander's done all he can. We've done all we can. Don't blame yourself for—\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Shayura says without looking up. She sits up enough to grab her steaming mug with two hands and drag the piping hot cider over to herself. She slouches over the mug, breathing in the aroma of cinnamon, honey, apples, and cloves. Her eyes drift shut, and for a moment, she seems more herself. \n\nAisha and Reed take a moment to breathe. Give Shayura time to breathe. \"I know,\" Shayura finally says in a small, guilty voice. \"I'm sorry.\" It's hard to tell if she's talking about Sloane, or about her behavior in general. \n\n\"You don't need to apologize to us,\" Reed says with a look to Aisha, finding her approval. \"You should apologize to Leitka  and his Ghost.\" \n\n\"It was Titan,\"  Shayura finally says, staring into her mug. Reed and Aisha look at each other, but neither interrupts. They let her reach that point at her own pace. \"I was back on Titan. Like when we were Lightless, surrounded by Hive.  There was this Knight… no matter how many times I killed him, he kept coming back.

The Lighthouse emits a soft tone; the nearby Ghosts begin reconstructing their dead Guardians after the match's conclusion. \n\nA scream rises from the same direction as the fire, spurring Aisha and Reed into action. The pair navigate the familiar Vex architecture quickly. Two more agonized screams fill the air. When they reach the source of the noise, Reed freezes in his tracks as he witnesses Shayura impale the other Guardian through the faceplate of his helmet with her Sword. The opponent's Ghost shrieks in frustration, trying desperately to get between Shayura and his Guardian. \n\nAisha is saying something, but all Reed hears is blood rushing in his ears. Not his blood though. The memory of it. Of something buried behind layered plates of carbon-polymer and plasteel weave. Something haunting his synaptic network. In that moment, Reed is outside of his own body, remembering faces frozen in stone, recalling the whispered plea of his Ghost's tortured voice on Io. \n\n|| Don't you see? || \n\n Reed's heart races. \n\n|| In Light, there is only weakness. || \n\nThe opposing team's Guardian is brought back to life by his Ghost, but before the Guardian can finish shouting a plea to Shayura, the Warlock cuts off his arm in one stroke. She cleaves her Sword through the top of his helmet in a brutal follow-through. Reed feels his chest tightening, feels a sense of panic kicking in. \n\n|| Only failure. || \n\n\"Shay, no!\" Aisha yells, running up to her friend. She wraps her arms around Shayura's midsection. Shayura screams like a frightened animal, lashing out with a swift slash of her Sword in the direction of the Guardian's corpse. \n\n|| Only death. || \n\n\"Shayura! The match is over!\" Reed shouts, snapping back to reality. \"The match is over!\" \n\nIt takes both Reed and Aisha to restrain the enraged Warlock. Shayura's voice cracks in a feral cry as flames race down her arms and swirl along the length of her blood-slicked Sword. \n\n\"No! No! Stop! No!\" Shayura howls, fighting against her comrades. Aisha grabs at Shayura's wrist, keeping her from swinging her Sword again as the freshly resurrected Guardian scrambles away. \n\n\"Shay,\" Aisha pleads, trying to get through to her. \"Shay!\" \n\nShayura screams an endless wail into the scalding Mercurian sky.","name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Plate","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"I have died for my fireteam, but I never once thought to live for them.\" —Reed-7, Exo Titan","hash":2671565007,"index":1685,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1260563064":{"displayProperties":{"description":"SIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-02-01 // MERCURY \n\nThe Exo Titan Reed-7 cuts an imposing silhouette across the Mercurian sands, the sun at his back. Reed and his Ghost fix their attention on two streaks of fire gleaming across the sky.  \n\n\"They're late,\" Reed's Ghost chirps. \n\n\"Again,\" Reed notes with a sigh. His eyes follow the burning trails across the dusty beige sky until they reveal a pair of jumpships entering the atmosphere. \n\n\"I'm picking up a… dispute on open comms,\" Reed's Ghost notes, bobbling through the air around his Guardian. \"You may want to brace for impact.\" \n\nThe jumpships dive low and hug the ground after reentry, kicking up a cloud of sand that billows across the ancient stone courtyard of the Caloris Spires. Reed turns his head to watch them speed off to the opposite horizon. \n\n \"—believe for a minute that's all we could've done!\" A voice shouts over comms and finishes in physical space as Reed's Warlock companion, Shayura,  transmats down to the surface. Crackling bands of energy ripple off of Shayura and another Guardian, a Hunter: Aisha. Shayura is incandescent with anger. Waves of golden fire lap at the sides of her face. \n\nReed doesn't say anything as his companions arrive. They're doing enough talking for everyone on Mercury, so he gives them their space, choosing instead to focus on the task at hand. He moves toward the looming structure of the Lighthouse and the Guardians gathered outside, waiting in their queue to compete in the prestigious Trials of Osiris. \n\nHis Ghost looks at him with concern; Reed reassures him with a gentle tap of his finger against the Ghost's shell. But Reed can hear his friends becoming increasingly frustrated with one another. Arguments like this have happened before: Is Eris trustworthy? Should the Vanguard track down Cayde's murderer? Was Cayde's death his own fault for being so reckless? Their disagreements had always ended with understanding. Today, however, things feel different. \n\n\"Hey!\" Reed turns and shouts back at them. It's louder than he intended. The bright red Exo recoils a little from the volume of his own voice. The clap of his rebuke distracts both Warlock and Hunter. They look up at him in sudden silence. \n\nReed lifts a hand to the back of his neck, scratching sheepishly. \"Can we do this later? Please?\" \n\nShayura and Aisha afford each other a brief and mild look. Wordlessly, they put away their conversational weapons for another time. Shayura draws a Sword and points it across the windswept courtyard toward a group of Guardians, indicating a challenge. \n\n\"Fine,\" Aisha agrees reluctantly. \n\nReed will take that as a victory, however small.","name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Helm","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"Under a sturdy enough helmet, no one can see how damaged you are.\" —Reed-7, Exo Titan","hash":1260563064,"index":1686,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2016308379":{"displayProperties":{"description":"SIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-02-04 // TENEMENT BUILDING ROOFTOP, PEREGRINE DISTRICT, LAST CITY\n\n\"Guardians are arriving from all across the system.

He hasn't been able to move since he reached the railing at the edge of the roof. Seeing the Traveler doing anything is cause for alarm, but seeing the Traveler radiating pulses of Light like some kind of beacon is nearly enough to stop the Titan's synthetic heart. He knows his Ghost is still talking, but he's effectively tuned it out. \n\nAisha and Shayura are on a lower terrace, far enough away that Reed can't hear them talking, just observe their body language. Both look tense, Shayura most of all. But for all that Reed wants to watch them, he can't seem to keep his eyes away from the Traveler—from the seething waves of blue-white light that erupt from inside its cracked shell, from the way the waves make him feel as they wash over him. It is a vindication to his hope, that the Traveler would not abandon humanity in their hour of need. He wants Shayura to see that, to feel his faith, but each time he looks at her, she seems more distant. \n\n\"Reed.\" His Ghost says for the fifth time. Reed finally acknowledges his name, looking at his Ghost with uneasy silence. \"I feel… strange. Something's happening.\" It's more a plea to the Guardian than anything. A plea of uncertainty and helplessness. Even his Ghost couldn't tell if the coming tide was going to wash them all away; if this was how the final moments of the Collapse were felt. But in this moment, Reed's only thoughts go to Shayura and Aisha. He looks down at them. \n\nHe sees Aisha, staring up at the Traveler with wide-eyed awe. He sees Shayura looking down, over the edge of the terrace. Her indifference weighs heavy, even as the Traveler throbs like a beating heart and then erupts into a blinding flash of light. \n\nReed's last thoughts before the light hits him are of his fireteam. His family. \n\nWhen the light fades, when his optic sensors recalibrate , he is moved to simulated tears. The Traveler hangs like a moon over the City. Whole. Reed's faith is reaffirmed in that instant, and tested when he sees Shayura walking away while the City erupts into cheers.","name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Greaves","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"If I could do everything over again, walk in my shoes a second time, I would do it all differently.\" —Reed-7, Exo Titan","hash":2016308379,"index":1687,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"48110686":{"displayProperties":{"description":"SIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-02-05 // SIMULATED LIGHTHOUSE, THE TOWER, LAST CITY\n\n\"There's still snow in the cockpit of my jumpship,\" Aisha says after she appears in a crackling wave of latticework from the subordinate Vex conflux now running simulations of the Lighthouse from the safety of the Tower. \n\n\"Is that why you're late?\" Reed-7 asks in a gently teasing tone. Aisha looks around, spreading her hands. \n\n\"And Shayura isn't?\" \n\n\"She's coming. How long did you stick around the Stranger's camp after we left?\" Reed wonders. Aisha looks away at the Lighthouse across the courtyard. He fails to notice the tension in her posture. \n\n\"Couple hours. I moved around. House of Salvation was putting down stakes out near some Vex ruins; wanted to make sure they didn't stick,\" Aisha explains, bringing two fingers up to her neck, depressing a button on her armor's collar that summons her helmet around her head in a flash of light. \n\nReed snorts and nods. \"This is weird, right?\" he asks, dropping the topic of Europa.

Don't know why, don't care.\"\n\nWhatever Aisha was going to say is abruptly cut off when Shayura manifests into the simulated space mid-stride. She walks straight past Reed and Aisha toward the Lighthouse. \"Come on.\" \n\nShayura's brusque entrance elicits a concerned look between Reed and Aisha, but they say nothing more on the matter. \n\nSIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-02-05 // SIMULATED TRIALS ARENA, SIMULATED LIGHTHOUSE\n\nReed's shoulder connects with a Guardian on the other team so hard, it breaks every bone in his opponent's chest and sends him straight through the wall. Reed pivots, turning to see Aisha firing her Hand Cannon through the torso of the other Guardian coming up on them with a pair of spectral blades drawn. She's been holding back and Reed can see it, all gunplay, none of her usual fire and flash. \n\n\"Where's Shayura?\" Reed asks as he reloads his Scout Rifle. Aisha points down a corridor with two fingers. \n\n\"She's been after that other Awoken Warlock since we started the match. I think she followed him that way,\" Aisha says, already breaking into a jog. \"It's three on one, c'mon.\" \n\nReed shakes his head, hurrying behind Aisha. He remembers what had happened the last time Shayura had broken off on her own. They shouldn't have come back to the Trials, not so soon, not after everything that's happened. Shayura pushed for this, trying to get the fireteam back to normal, but now he worries it was too early. \n\nWhen they finally find Shayura, she's standing over a still-living Awoken Guardian whose helmet has been broken, revealing one of his eyes. He stares up at her, at her fire-shrouded Sword. Aisha and Reed train their firearms, prepared to back Shayura up if she misses the finishing blow for the match. But Reed senses something is wrong. Shayura's sight line isn't aimed down at the Guardian; it's aimed up at her opponent's Ghost. \n\n\"Shay?\" Aisha asks, a nervous tremor in her voice. \n\nShayura lashes out, striking the Ghost with her Sword and knocking it to the ground. The Guardian exhales a scream of plight, and Shayura quickly draws her Sidearm and plants a round in his forehead. The Ghost chirps, squawks. It is only damaged. Shayura holsters her Sidearm again. \n\n\"Shay!\" Reed shouts, dropping his Scout Rifle and rushes over to her. This time, though, Shayura expels a blast of force from her palm that knocks Reed onto his back. She turns to the Ghost again, gripping her Sword in both hands, only to feel a sudden stabbing cold rise up her legs and arms. \n\nReed watches as blue-black ice crusts over Shayura's legs, snuffs out her fire, and freezes her arm solid, Sword and all. Feather-ice bristles off of her body along with waves of visible cold. Reed's focus snaps to Aisha, one hand extended and waves of cold emanating from her outstretched palm. She had saved the Ghost from Shayura, but the power she wields—he knows it isn't the Light. \n\nHe knows this will change everything.","name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Mark","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"No matter how strong you are, there will always be a weight too heavy to carry alone.\" —Reed-7, Exo Titan","hash":48110686,"index":1688,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1001798188":{"displayProperties":{"description":"SIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-02-01 // MERCURY\n\nFlames roll up the front windscreen of a classic AFv2 Octavian  on its entry to Mercury's thin atmosphere.

A handful of colorful decorations for the Festival of the Lost hang overhead, with more being set up outside. An anchor of community in the wake of a tumultuous time. \n\n\"How's today feeling?\" Aisha asks, sitting forward with her elbows on her knees. Shayura doesn't answer. \n\nAisha watches Reed-7 stand in line at a food kiosk across the way. \"Did you talk to Ikora yet?\" she tries again.

Aisha offers Reed a supportive but strained smile in return. \"Careful,\" Reed notes as she reaches out for a mug, \"they're hot.\" \n\n\"There's cinnamon in yours,\" he says to Shayura. She gives him a thumbs-up without lifting her head off the table. Aisha offers Reed a wordless look of concern and shakes her head. Their talk had not gone well while he was away. \n\n\"I know you're upset about Sloane,\" Reed says. \"But you know the commander's done all he can. We've done all we can. Don't blame yourself for—\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Shayura says without looking up. She sits up enough to grab her mug with two hands and drags the piping hot cider over to herself. She slouches over the mug, breathing in the aroma of cinnamon, honey, apples, and cloves. Her eyes drift shut and, for a moment, she seems more herself. \n\nAisha and Reed take a moment to breathe. Give Shayura time to breathe. \"I know,\" Shayura finally says in a small, guilty voice. \"I'm sorry.\" It's hard to tell if she's talking about Sloane, or about her behavior in general. \n\n\"You don't need to apologize to us,\" Reed says with a look to Aisha, who nods back in support and affirmation. \"You should apologize to Leitka and his Ghost.\" \n\n\"It was Titan,\" Shayura finally explains without looking up from her mug. Reed and Aisha look at each other, but neither interrupts. They let Shayura reach that point at her own pace. \"I was back on Titan. Like when we were Lightless, surrounded by Hive. There was this Knight… no matter how many times I killed him, he kept coming back. I should've died out there.\" \n\n\"But you didn't,\" Aisha says, reaching out across the table to take Shayura's hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. \"We got our Light back, and—\"\n\n\"What happens when the Darkness closes in?\" Shayura asks, though she knows neither Reed nor Aisha have the answer. \"Will she be Lightless again? Alone?\" \n\nReed and Aisha share a look, and the Exo reaches across the table, laying one of his large hands atop Shayura's hand that Aisha holds. Reed's silence is stability, and Aisha smiles across the small distance to him in thanks. The three fireteam members are all the family they have, and in this moment of weakness, Aisha has to hope that family is enough to make it through the darkness. \n\nOr, failing that, enough to make the journey worth taking.","name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Grasps","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"I could have done more.

From their spot on a terrace, the Hunter Aisha and her Awoken Warlock companion Shayura bear witness to the turn of the age. \n\n\"Do you remember Chicago? \" Aisha asks, unable to pry her eyes away from the Traveler's silhouette. Shayura's response is a non-verbal acknowledgement. \"I thought we were gonna die in the Crypts,\" Aisha continues. \n\nLight ripples from the Traveler, washing over the pair like foaming tides from far distant shores.

Aisha looks at her, surprised to see Shayura's focus not on the Traveler but down on the street. \"I never forgot how abandoned we felt,\" Shayura adds, a tightness in her voice. \n\nAisha's attention is drawn back to the Traveler as it throbs like a beating heart and erupts into a blinding flash of light. Aisha braces, as if for an incoming attack, but shudders when she feels the wave of Light crash against and roll past her. When it fades, Aisha sees the impossible. The Traveler, once shattered by its exertion to destroy Ghaul, is now whole. \n\nThe City rises up in a riotous cheer; Aisha turns to Shayura, but she is gone.

The mosaic of conversations is a distracting din to Shayura, who rests at the edge of a terrace watching the crowded streets of onlookers, eyes upturned to the shadow of their silent god looming in the heavens. \n\nShe can't help but feel that the people who dwell beneath the Traveler do so out of desperation and delusion. They were told for generations that this was the only safe refuge on Earth. Even after that assumption had been challenged by the Red Legion and now the Darkness, they cling to that desperate hope. They cling to an illusion of an all-powerful god that will protect them, when—Shayura believes—they had never been in any real danger before the Traveler arrived. \n\nShayura hears Aisha, talking beside her, but her thoughts are distant. Shayura grunts a reply, hoping indifferent is enough. But Aisha keeps talking, something about Chicago, about memory. Shayura grips the railing and watches the people staring up at the Traveler, and she cannot bear to look up with them. \n\n\"I remember,\" Shayura finally replies, her own internal fears overlapping with memories of dark times that her fireteam experienced below the ruins of Chicago. \"I never forgot how abandoned we felt,\" Shayura adds, a tightness in her voice. The day Ghaul stole the Light, when they were so far from home, when they went from hunters to hunted. \n\nShayura also remembers what went unsaid. She remembers those feelings of desperation and abandonment and how she would have accepted any opportunity if it meant living. Her desperate moment did not end in such darkness, but she cannot help but wonder about other Guardians. That when faced with the choice between annihilation and salvation, they might make the wrong choice. \n\nIt is in that moment of quiet revelation that the Traveler stirs for the first time in years. A glow builds within, and only then does Shayura look up at her silent god. A wave of Light washes over her, and it feels like absolution. \n\nWhile the City is awash in Light, with the fearful and the faithful holding congress in the shadow of an indifferent god, Shayura slips away into the crowd. She does not need to witness the Traveler's grandiose power to know what is being asked of her, and she does not need time to set herself to work. \n\nShayura's path is clear.","name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Boots","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"I walk without hesitation toward my destiny.\" —Shayura, Awoken Warlock","hash":469005214,"index":1694,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"605724052":{"displayProperties":{"description":"SIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-01-03 // BAZAAR, THE TOWER, LAST CITY\n\nGuilt and shame twist like spectral blades into Shayura's stomach.  Sitting under the trappings of New Monarchy's crimson-shrouded enclosure, her focus is locked squarely on the table's wood-grain surface. The sound of her breathing feels uncomfortably loud, but at the same time, the noise of the nearby crowds are muffled and distorted as if they were underwater. \n\n\"How's today feeling?\" \n\nAll Shayura can hear clearly is her own breathing. She slouches forward more, fingers sliding up into her hair, elbows propped up on the table, fighting to stay in the present when her mind demands she fixate on the past.  \n\n\"Did you talk to Ikora yet?\" \n\nA new knife of guilt slides in. Shayura tries to swallow, but her throat is dry. She'd barely had the energy to come here; it makes her feel all the more worthless. \n\n\"No,\" Shayura finally says, her mind fuzzy, her response delayed. \"I will,\" she promises, because she knows that's what Aisha wants to hear. \"I'm sorry.\" \n\n\"Hey, no,\" Aisha says, putting a hand on Shayura's shoulder at some point. The tactile connection is a grounding presence, bringing Shayura back into the moment. \"Don't. We've all been through a lot. I should've paid attention to how hurt you were before we went into the match. I'm sorry we fought; I'm sorry I yelled at you.\" \n\nAisha's plaintive tone hurts as much as it helps. Shayura sinks into a slouch of defeat, feeling her closest friend suffering because of her own shortcomings. It only makes her feel smaller, guiltier. \n\nShayura looks at Aisha out of the corner of her eye, seeing the twinned look of support and worry on her face. \"Can Guardians be unfit for duty?\" Shayura wonders aloud, her voice muffled by the tabletop. \n\n\"I mean…\" Aisha replies. Her hesitation has a palpable sting. \n\n \"I don't know if I'm okay,\" Shayura finds the courage to admit. Her heart races as the words pass her lips. When she feels Aisha's arms around her shoulders, it steadies her pulse. Shayura relaxes into the supportive embrace of a friend. \n\n\"It's okay not to be okay,\" Aisha says, and for a moment, Shayura believes it. For a moment, knives of doubt and guilt feel blunted. But only for a moment. \n\n\"That's why you should talk to Ikora. She knows. She understands.\" \n\n\"Drinks.\" \n\nThe word startles Shayura. She can hear the whirring hiss of Reed-7's articulated joints, the clank of his armor. \n\n\"…they're hot.\" \n\n\"There's cinnamon in yours,\" Reed says, and Shayura musters the energy to give him a half-hearted thumbs-up. \n\n\"I know you're upset about Sloane,\" Reed says, and suddenly Shayura's heart is racing in worry again. He says something else, but all she hears is the blood rushing in her ears and the thundering beat in her chest. \n\nWorried that he's waiting on her for a response, Shayura interjects with something non-committal. \"Thanks,\" she says weakly. The scent of apples and cinnamon hits her. It brings her back to her earliest memories as a Guardian in the Tower, when she first met Aisha and Reed. Shayura sits up enough to grab a steaming mug with two hands and drags the piping hot cider over to herself, breathing in the scent of happier times. \n\n\"I know,\" Shayura finally says in a small, guilty voice. She doesn't know what she's referring to, but she assumes it's what they want to hear. \"I'm sorry.\" \n\n\"You don't need to apologize to us,\" Reed replies. \"You should apologize to Leitka and his Ghost.\" Mention of the Guardian Leitka twists those knives of guilt in Shayura's stomach. She breathes in the scent of cinnamon and apples again, deeply. These are her friends, she tries to remember. This is her family, she concedes. \n\n\"It was Titan,\" Shayura finally admits, afraid of what the truth means but unwilling to dig too deeply into her own terrifying delusions. \"I was back on Titan. Like when we were Lightless, surrounded by Hive. There was this Knight… no matter how many times I killed him, he kept coming back. I should've died out there.\" \n\n\"But you didn't,\" Aisha says. Shayura feels a hand on top of hers and sees Aisha squeezing her palm. It feels like it's happening to someone else, and yet, it is still reassuring. \"We got our Light back, and—\"\n\n\"What happens when the Darkness closes in?\" Shayura needs to know, though she knows neither Reed nor Aisha have the answer. \"Will she be Lightless again? Alone?\" The thought of Sloan dying alone on the arcology eviscerates her. \n\nReed's hand joins Aisha's in a wordless reply.

She is silent in her anger. \n\n\"Now entering Mercury's atmosphere,\" her Ghost chirps. Shayura looks up to watch flames roar over the exterior of the cockpit and sees her face in the distorted curve of the glass. No one reflection is true in this moment; no image perfectly accurate. \n\n\"Reed is already waiting for us,\" her Ghost adds, worried. \n\nShayura hears him, but only in part. Something pulls at her insides like anxious fingers. \n\n\"Open a channel to Aisha,\" Shayura says. Her Ghost hesitates, then beeps in compliance. The cockpit suddenly feels cavernous. As if she could shout out into the universe. \n\nHer Ghost edges closer and hovers nearby. \"The connection's open.\" \n\n\"We shouldn't just leave her behind,\" Shayura says into the void with a tightness in her throat. \n\n \"Not our call, Shay.

Words are insufficient. \n\n\"She's preparing for transmat,\" Shayura's Ghost quietly offers. \"We're in range.\" \n\nShayura nods and swallows, but the anger is rising up in her, and she can feel it creeping into her bones. Wisps of gold fire slither up her arms. \n\n\"Zavala doesn't see it. He's trying to do the work of two Vanguard leaders right now.

Nearby, their third fireteam member, Reed-7, stands as a looming crimson silhouette in Titan armor. \n\n\"The commander asked her to fall back and she didn't! Don't pin this on him!\" Aisha goes on, needling Shayura with a furious intensity. \n\nShayura pivots to stare at Aisha; the fire building around her discharges in an upward blast. \"If he wants to lead, he should be willing to take criticism for his decisions!\" \n\n\"Hey!\" Reed-7 finally interjects with a shout. The broad-shouldered Exo shifts his posture awkwardly but stands his ground. Aisha and Shayura look over at him in silence. \n\nReed lifts a hand to the back of his neck. \"Can we do this later? Please?\" \n\nShayura feels Aisha's eyes on her. She tempers her own expression to match her friend's calmer one, reluctant in her assent, but the ember of anger in her refuses to go out.

Her breath is visible as a cold fog.  Fragments of Ghost shells are scattered atop the console, each glittering with a faint sheen of ice. The Warlock stares at her reflection in the shattered central navigation panel, fragmented, broken. \n\n\"You are late for your weekly scheduled Trials match,\" Shayura's Ghost chirps from over her shoulder. She does not look away from her broken reflection. \"Do you… want me to elevate the atmospheric controls so the ship is warmer on your return?\" \n\nShayura blinks her eyes shut, then opens them, fixed on her Ghost. \"The cold is a reminder,\" Shayura says like a mantra. She looks back at the fragmented shells of the dead Ghosts and clenches her hands into fists. \n\n\"I am ready.\" \n\nShayura is torn apart into motes of Light and threads of energy, reformed into the simulation of Mercury mid-stride.  She walks straight past Reed and Aisha toward the Lighthouse, purpose behind her every movement. \"Come on.\" \n\nShayura's attention is focused ahead at another group of Guardians, to an Awoken Warlock—much like herself—whom she has heard much of.

The rifle's wielder, an Awoken Warlock, lowers his firearm and grunts in frustration. He kicks off the ground, stepping up into the air and glides across the sky in search of a better vantage point. It's here that another body impacts him in a tackle, sending him crashing to the ground far below. \n\nThe Warlock's Scout Rifle rattles out of his hand on impact. He switches to his gold-plated Sidearm as he rises up onto one knee, only to have the gun swatted aside by the flat of a curved Sword. Shayura, carried aloft on wings of fire, slowly descends from the air. She moves the Sword's blade from hand to throat. \n\n\"Go on,\" her quarry says, \"you earned it.\" But Shayura isn't thinking about the match. This isn't about the Trials; it's about discipline. \n\n\"I know what you did on Europa,\" Shayura says to the Warlock. \"I know you're a traitor to the Light.\" At first, he opens his mouth to speak a denial, but then he tenses and takes a step back. \n\n\"It's not that simple,\" the Warlock says, shaking his head. \"You haven't talked to Eris. You don't understand—\" The Warlock's words are cut off as Shayura lunges in, smashing the butt of her Sword against his face, shattering part of his helmet and knocking him to the ground. \n\nThe Warlock groans, grasping at his face, then looks up at Shayura in vivid anger. \"It's not illegal! The Vanguard—\"\n\n\"I am not here on behalf of the Vanguard,\" Shayura says with imperious certainty. Flames begin to spread down the length of her Sword. \"I am here on behalf of the Light.\" \n\nThe Warlock snorts and smiles sarcastically. His body language implies he doesn't respect her power. \"I'm not afraid of you. Come on, end the match.\" \n\n\"I'm not here for you,\" Shayura insists. Now, he feels fear. \n\nAisha and Reed arrive a moment later, guns raised and ready to assist Shayura. She fights back a scowl at seeing them but turns her attention to the Ghost hovering at the Warlock's side. \n\n\"Shay?\" Aisha asks, a nervous tremor in her voice. \n\nShayura lashes out, striking the Ghost with her Sword and knocking it to the ground. The Guardian opens his mouth to shout a plea, but Shayura quickly draws her Sidearm and plants a round in his forehead. The Ghost chirps, squawks; damaged but alive. She holsters her Sidearm again and looks to the Ghost. \n\n\"Shay!\" Reed shouts, and she hears him rushing up behind her. She wouldn't be dragged away, not this time. Shayura turns and expels a blast of force from her palm that knocks Reed onto his back. She quickly reorients to the Ghost and raises her Sword for another strike, when suddenly, her legs prickle with the unearthly chill of deep space. \n\nShayura tries to let out a scream, but her lungs flash-freeze, and crystals of Stasis energy encrust her body. She turns her head, just enough to make eye contact with Aisha and witness the unthinkable. The last person she sees before her world is ice and darkness. Her closest friend, forsaking the Light, embracing the Darkness. \n\nThe look of betrayal on Shayura's face freezes in the ice.","name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Bond","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"Each scar I bear, a trial survived.\" —Shayura, Awoken Warlock","hash":708549601,"index":1697,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2304861612":{"displayProperties":{"description":"SIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-01-02 // TRIALS ARENA, THE LIGHTHOUSE, MERCURY \n\nTitan's sea of liquid methane crashes against the listing hull of the New Pacific Arcology. The wind whips with hurricane force, sending a freezing sea spray lashing across the crooked metal frame of a crumbling catwalk. Flares of atomic fire bloom in the mist and roll off the arcology's walls. Human and inhuman screams echo out into impossible seas. \n\nTwo dozen Hive Thrall come pouring out of an encrusted airlock, climbing over one another, jaws snapping. They scurry across every surface not slicked by liquid methane; drawn like moths to a beacon of golden flame. Shayura stands against the crashing tide of chitin and bone, a Sword of fire held fast in two hands, screaming as she cleaves through the masses of encroaching death. \n\nBurning embers of Thrall rain around her, but with each dispatched wave of necrotic soldiers, it feels as though their numbers double. She is pressed by the tide of Hive, inching closer and closer to the jagged end of the catwalk hanging over the churning sea. When the Thrall recede, she is thankful for a respite. But the towering Knight that drops from the airlock is an escalation, not a victory. \n\nEdging a half-step backward, Shayura knows that the only way out is through. Wings of flame roar off of her back, leaving a trail of rippling heat and hollowed-out Thrall in her wake. Her Sword clashes with the Knight's shield, shattering it in a single blow. Her follow-through cleaves through the Knight's arm, down into its chest. \n\nShayura turns on her heel toward the remaining Thrall. She can feel the Light in her ebbing and knows that they will overwhelm her if she doesn't succeed now. Death against the Hive is never a sure return; not after what happened to Taeko-3 and her fireteam here. A blinding pain hits Shayura in her back. Her vision swims, mind reels; had she missed one? Feeling the warmth of blood running below her armor, Shayura turns to see the Hive Knight reborn, Sword covered in her blood. \n\nScreaming inside her helmet, Shayura feels a deep panic build in her chest. She knows a Hive death ritual when she sees it, and she walked straight into their trap. She rolls away from the Knight's next swing and into the reach of Thrall that tear at her armor. Mustering the last of her Solar energy, Shayura calls up a cyclonic pillar of flame that twists up into the sky and consumes the Knight. \n\nThe revenant Knight emerges from the flames, already reconstituting. Shayura leaps forward and drives her Sword through his face, tackling him to the ground. Her Solar aura flickers and fades; smoke and steam billow from her back and shoulders. \n\n\"Shay?\" \n\nShe hears one of the surviving Thrall speak in a human voice. Shayura twists her Sword in the Knight's face and shakes sizzling green blood onto the catwalk. The Knight begins to reform again in a horrifying blaze of green flame, but as it reaches out toward her, she cuts off his arm and sends her Sword through the top of his head in a brutal follow-through. \n\nThe Thrall wails. She can feel an arm around her waist, restraining her. She kicks and struggles, crying out as the last wisps of Praxic fire twist down her arm and Sword. \n\n\"No! No! Stop! No!\" Shayura howls, fighting against the pull of the Thrall. \n\n \"Shay,\" the Thrall cry in the voices of her friends. \"Shay!\" \n\nShayura screams into the impossible seas.","name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Vestment","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"I hold faith in the Light, unwavering.\"—Shayura, Awoken Warlock","hash":2304861612,"index":1698,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3525313139":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"I don't want to do this,\" Katabasis said flatly.

Calus's pleasure barge whirred as engines fired to life in the distance. \"A job every now and then's one thing…\"\n\nKatabasis thumbed the small royal jewel seated in his newly gifted imperial coin. He didn't know if this was an invitation one could refuse, and operating outside of the City's jurisdiction had become more and more lucrative in a time when Consensus resources felt taxed beyond their limit. Without a Hunter Vanguard soliciting reports of his activities, it had become all too easy to slip away on illicit solo missions.\n\nGilgamesh, Katabasis's Ghost, leered at the Guardian before pivoting to bask in the shadow of the Leviathan. \"The trust of an emperor isn't something to squander.\"\n\nIt was a trust Kata and Gilly had fought hard to obtain. Tracking game through the jungles of Venus. Poaching strange quantum jellyfish in the storms of Saturn. Putting down Red Legion traitors—anyone seeking to corral Calus and his loyalists into a paddock for Caiatl's judgment. Katabasis's hunts had always been painted against the grand planet-scape of a wild frontier. He wasn't a fan of fish in a barrel, and he didn't want to become one. Something about sitting in a Cabal cruiser in empty space felt awfully like a sealed barrel surrounded by ocean. Locked in with nowhere to run.\n\n\"More like I'm the only one left listening to his ranting.\" Katabasis pocketed the imperial. \"His kid is making him antsy. Probably reckless too. I swear the Reddies we're gunning down are just anyone Calus can find with a name worth taking,\" he stated nonchalantly.\n\n\"Is that so bad?\"\n\n\"Used to be the only difference between Reddies and Calus's boys was politics.

But what happened the second we started to choose our own path out in the shadows?\"\n\nThe Hunter looked to his Ghost. \"We got stronger; richer.\" Gilly had a nose for this sort of thing.

The Ghost felt her Guardian expire before his body hit the ground. They had expected a one-on-one challenge, but instead had sprung an ambush: a fake rite meant to draw Guardians into a killing field. Scorpius turrets deployed and locked targets. Phalanxes walled Guardian and Ghost in, as planted demolition charges armed. A heavy slug thrower spun up in Cabal hands. Gunfire crowded the air, and the Guardian responded in kind. The bloodbath resolved in moments, as so many do. Encircled by several broken Cabal defenders, the Ghost felt her Guardian's Light fade.\n\nShe heard the remaining Cabal searching for her; looking to finish her off and lure in another. She shimmied from under her Guardian's body, snaked through dead Cabal, and slinked over oil-stained dirt—out of sight, avoiding detection from the scanning turrets above. The Ghost made her way to the outskirts of the battleground before doubling back to exploit the turret's blind spot.\n\nRays of Light cascaded over the turret's frame as the Ghost hacked its targeting computer, delivered an override to its command module, and redirected authority to herself. She told herself the Cabal were her enemy. She did not listen to their gasps of surprise as rounds loosed from the dual Scorpius barrels. She did not look at the confusion on their faces as heavy projectiles punched them down. It was all she could do not to feel the same remorse she had so many years ago when she had last needed to defend her charge.\n\nIt was done. A lone Ghost in the deathly stillness of the EDZ.\n\nShe drifted passed the massacre and hovered over her Guardian. She wondered: if the Traveler had chosen Torobatl instead of Earth, would her allegiances be reversed? Would she be battle-sister to a Cabal Legionary holding the line against the forces of Xivu Arath? Humanity had its tyrants: warlords and brigands from before the Golden Age, through the Dark Age, and long after the City's establishment. What made her side the right one? It was a question she had been asking too often these days in the spaces between heartbeats.\n\nShe remembered those first desperate months after finding her Guardian. Their journey to the City had not been easy, and they had fought  with each other many times before she gained his trust. Maybe there is was no difference. At one time, her Guardian had felt that he was simply a victim of circumstance; maybe the Cabal were too.\n\nShe looked to her Guardian, now a proud defender of the City, and to the Cabal bodies around him. Today they were enemies, but tomorrow… She thought about potential, of how the Traveler took barren worlds and rejuvenated them. Like a miracle, a resurrection. Reborn not as what they were, but as what they could be. If that's what Ghosts were meant to do with their Guardians, then maybe anyone could be saved with the right guidance, even a Cabal brute.\n\nShe raised her Guardian once more, determined to keep cultivating his potential.\n\nHe looked out over the battlefield at her handiwork. \"They weren't expecting you, were they?\"","name":"Challenger Shell","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"For Ghosts ready to face any challenge.","hash":3536408166,"index":1700,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1305996499":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The Tower Hangar had never been a particularly quiet space, but today's din seemed to set record levels. The whoosh  of jumpships had been near-constant as fireteam after fireteam rolled through on their way to one of many battlegrounds . \n\nLuckily, Saint-14 had a voice that could carry over it all: \"Welcome, Guardians!\" Standing in his usual spot by the Gray Pigeon , he bellowed jubilantly to Trial-seekers, greeting each and every one as if they were old friends. \n\nUnderneath his cheer, however, there was an unease. Some internal wire pulled taut by the arrival of the Pyramids. Ever since the latest incident in the Trials,  his tension had increased daily, steadily ratcheting towards an inevitable breaking point. \n\nThere had been incidents before—that was to be expected when Guardians clashed. The point was to limit those altercations to a controlled environment. Yet lately, Saint wondered whether he really was in control after all…\n\nBut just as the clouds of doubt began to settle, they lifted when the crowd parted to reveal a familiar gold-hooded figure  in their midst. His shoulders seemed a little more stooped without Sagira zipping around them, but his purposeful stride, his furrowed brow… these remained the same. \n\n\"Osiris!\" Saint called out. Several heads swiveled in his direction, startled by the sudden shout. Osiris, for his part, merely looked bemused as he changed course. \n\n\"What is it?\" Osiris asked as he drew closer. \"Did something happen?\" \n\n\"No,\" Saint responded quickly. Too quickly. \"Well, yes… A small something. Under control, but…\" He was stumbling, unsure how to explain himself. \"I sent a message. You didn't get it?\" \n\nOsiris frowned, impatient. \"I've received a lot of messages lately. Was it urgent?\" \n\nSaint flinched. He didn't know it had to be urgent. \"It's about the Trials. They are named for you and… now that you're here, I thought it was time you…\"\n\n\"Ah. You want me to take over the Trials.\" Osiris shrugged. \"It's not a good time. Shut them down if you're tired of it.\" \n\n\"What? No!\" Saint hadn't expected this. \"Not tired. I am worried! There have been—\" He stopped, suddenly aware of the passersby. He gestured for Osiris to follow him into his ship. \n\nOsiris crossed his arms. \"I'm keeping Lord Saladin waiting. The issue of the Cabal is somewhat urgent. As you can see.\" \n\n\"I know, but…\" Saint lowered his voice, \"But there is a kind of war brewing in the Trials too. Guardians going too far. Wielding Darkness.\" \n\n\"Really?\" Osiris' eyes glinted with renewed interest. \"To what effect?\" \n\nSaint stared at him. Inside, the wire tightened one more impossible  inch. At last, he said, \"It varies.\" \n\n\"Interesting.\" Osiris rubbed his chin, thinking. A datapad at his hip dinged with a reminder. He groaned at it, then turned back to Saint. \"If it happens again, take notes, will you?\" \n\nWithout waiting for a response, he turned away. Saint's iron arm shot out and grabbed him by the elbow. \n\n \"Is that all this is to you? An experiment?\" Saint spat, trying and failing to keep his voice down. He couldn't contain himself any longer. He'd waited for days for a response. Fretting over the silence, but forcing himself to give his comrade space. \"So what am I then? Your assistant? Just because Sagira is gone—\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Osiris snarled, yanking his arm back. \"Never speak of her to me again. Understand?\" \n\nSaint stepped back, immediately awash in regret. His mind raced. He should say something, anything, to make it better. To put things to rights. But what? \n\nBefore he could come up with an answer, Osiris spoke: \"Continue the Trials or don't. But if you don't have the stomach  to collect that data, someone should. It could be key to our survival. All of ours.\" And with that, he strode off. \n\nSaint watched as Osiris disappeared into the throng. The tension in him was gone.

Muscle memory kicked in, and she sent the ship screaming down to the hard deck. She buzzed the treetops and cranked her ship around the Cosmodrome's rugged mesas. If they wanted to chase her down, they'd have to prove they had the chops.\n\nShe blazed a tight circuit around a spire of rock, weapons hot, expecting to light up the pursuing squadron. Instead, she watched the fighters continue off into the distance. Likely on a bombing run to soften up known Hive nests. They probably hadn't even noticed her. \n\nHolliday throttled down, gained altitude, and slowed her breathing to counteract the adrenaline still coursing through her veins. She realized with sick amazement that she was actually disappointed. \n\nIt's better this way, she thought. Let someone with lives to spare clean up the Cabal. \n\nDespite Amanda's self-reassurance, her disappointment lingered. Since becoming the Tower shipwright, her combat sorties had become less and less frequent. She hadn't realized how much she missed them. They made her feel like she was doing her part. \n\nBut even after all she had achieved, after all she'd survived, she still felt like she was missing out. Not doing enough. Falling behind. The people of the Tower saw her as an engineer and a pilot. But in her dreams, she was still a malnourished little girl, trudging toward the Last City as jumpships shrieked overhead. \n\nThat's what happens when your best friends are immortal, she thought. My life is just a blip on the radar compared to the Guardians and Hive gods. Hell, even this ship will probably outlast me. \n\nHer brooding was interrupted by a small flashing indicator on her dash. Huh. She must have overloaded a plasma converter during her evasive maneuvers. Something else to fix. It was always something. \n\nAmanda smiled and set course for the Tower.

They had only just disembarked and would've stumbled directly into the dispute, if it hadn't been for Crow's reflexes. Thanks to his espionage work, his sixth sense for private conversations was beyond compare. It was nice to know that skill was just as useful at home as it was in the field. \n\nDamn,\" Holliday murmured as they watched Osiris storm off. Crow looked at her, hoping for an explanation. Who was this Exo? Who was the \"her\" never to be mentioned? \"I'll tell you later,\" she whispered, stepping out from their hiding spot. \n\n\"Holliday!\" Crow sputtered. But it was too late. She was already at the Exo's side, placing a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. \n\nHe shuffled his feet, weighing his options. Even in the smoothest of circumstances, every new introduction was an occasion for anxiety. Not many Guardians wore masks in the Tower, and much as he wished he could join them, he knew what could happen if he showed his face. Still, the longer he wore the mask, the more conspicuous he felt. He was bound to raise someone's suspicions eventually. \n\nOr perhaps not. The Exo was wearing a helmet, and Holliday seemed to accept it without question, as she had Crow's not too long ago. \n\nBesides, what was more suspect: perpetually wearing a mask or skulking in the shadows? Crow ducked out from under the step, attempting to look casual. He approached just as Holliday was saying, \"You'll let me know if I can haul a few bricks?\" \n\nHe barely had time to wonder what they had been discussing when the Exo turned to him, thundering, \"And who is this? You are skinny, but you move with power. You must be a Hunter.\" \n\nWhatever perfectly innocuous greeting Crow had cued up flew right out of his head. Throat tight, he nodded mutely as Holliday slapped him on the back with a laugh. \n\n\"This is Crow. He's our intel guy on this whole Cabal thing,\" she said. \"And Crow, this is Saint-14. He's… well, he's lots of things, but his main gig is running the Trials of Osiris.\" \n\nFor once, he was grateful for the mask. Otherwise, they might have noticed his surprise at the name. He'd heard before, of course—both here, where it was uttered in tones of admiration, and on the Tangled Shore, where it was spat in loathing. Neither seemed to fit the jovial Titan grasping his forearm. \n\nHis spy instincts saved him again. \"Really? That's interesting,\" Crow remarked, returning the gesture with a little extra muscle. \"I've only ever heard them referred to as the Trials. I had no idea Osiris was involved.\" \n\nSaint pulled back with a chagrined chuckle. \"He is involved with many important tasks. I help where I can.\" \n\n\"You do more than just help,\" Holliday corrected. \"I hope the old man knows he owes you.\" \n\nCrow looked to Saint. He'd never imagined that Osiris would owe anyone anything. \n\n\"Help carries no debt, friend. We must uplift each other without expecting a return. Except Banshee,\" he added, almost seeming to wink at them. \"Who owes me Glimmer.\" \n\nCrow laughed, utterly disarmed. He was surprised at how much he liked Saint. And how much he wanted to be liked in return. What could this affable character possibly have in common with an intimidating figure like Osiris? \n\nOutside of his thoughts, he realized Holliday was talking. He tuned back in just as she said, \"…things gotta be equitable.

It occurred to him that Saint and Osiris must've known each other for a long time. What was it like, the assurance and ease of having someone else to watch your back like that? To fight side by side for the same cause? He ached to know. \n\n\"Always nice to talk, Miss Holliday. You too, skinny Crow,\" Saint quipped as he strode off. \n\nCrow watched as the broad-shouldered Titan parted the crowd with ease. \"Nice to meet you,\" he replied lamely, too late to be heard. \n\nHolliday chuckled. Crow shot her a look.

He wondered if there was a unifying thread binding all those events together. But he would have no time to ponder such things.\n\nA shadow crept over Mithrax: broad shoulders, a curling horn. Seeing the stark outline of Lord Shaxx looming on the stairs elicited centuries-old instincts, and it was temperance that kept Mithrax's hands from his weapon. \n\n\"I didn't expect to actually find you here,\" Shaxx said as he continued down the stairs with slow, plodding steps. \"Were you there?\"\n\n\"What?\" \n\nShaxx came to stand beside Mithrax at the railing. \"Were you there?\" he asked again. This time, he pointed, without looking, to a place on the horizon beyond the Traveler.\n\nMithrax followed Shaxx's gesture with his eyes.

But the presence of the Traveler and the question that nagged at the back of his mind stayed his hands. \"How many?\" he asked, not wanting to know the answer. \n\nShaxx deflated, folded his arms over the railing, and rested his considerable weight against it. \"Hundreds,\" he said quietly. \"All of them died afraid.\"\n\nMithrax felt Ether mixing with bile in the back of his throat.

But he tempered his anger, sighed so deep that the Ether on his breath was briefly visible as an iridescent cloud.\n\n\"How many Humans have you killed?\" Shaxx wondered.\n\n\"Too many,\" Mithrax answered, and even that felt insufficient on his tongue; the thought of it twisted his insides around. He sighed again, deeper this time, and Shaxx watched the sublimated Ether glitter in the dim light. \n\n\"When I heard you were in the Tower,\" Shaxx said, \"I thought I'd just throw you over the edge of the wall. I thought about the people I watched die at the hands of your Houses over the years.

Huddled together in a collapsed storm drain. They had stolen food during a… a time of famine. Maybe it was for themselves, maybe another settlement, maybe family…\" Shaxx shrugged. \"I killed them. All three, with my bare hands.\"\n\n\"My victims were Humans too,\" Shaxx clarified, and the Kell felt his anger twist into confusion. \"I was a Warlord in the Dark Ages. Convinced myself of the necessity of my own barbarism by painting it with noble colors. Those loyal to me built a legend that masked the blood and the rot. But it's still there.\" He tapped his fingers against his breastplate. \"Deep down.\"\n\nThe shadows had become long, stars now visible in the sky, and the Traveler was cast in half shadow.\n\n\"There was a ship,\" Mithrax eventually replied. \"It may have been soldiers.

We slaughtered any who resisted and rounded up those who surrendered.\"\n\nShaxx turned to look at Mithrax, a wordless question in his faceless mask.\n\n\"We argued what to do with the prisoners. Some suggested we keep them as warning-trophies. Others said to barter with them.\" Mithrax looked away, shoulders sagged. \"But I was young. Impatient.\" He closed his eyes. \"I opened the airlock. It seemed the simplest solution.\"\n\nBoth soldiers sank into silence again and remained so as the last glimpse of sunlight descended beyond the horizon. Shaxx sullenly took his leave, and Mithrax was left with the remnants of anger and confusion, and paradoxically—an answer.\n\nHe saw then the thread of choices leading to this moment.

His first instinct was to turn around and leave, but he noticed the hooded figure standing nervously nearby, conspicuously inconspicuous.\n\nTheir hooded cloak was pulled low over their face, but they leaned to the side, intent on catching every angry shout from the crowd of locals in the corner.\n\n\"Tell what's-his-name to take it easy,\" Drifter grumbled as he walked by. \"I'll handle this.\"\n\n\"Take it easy,\" parroted a polite voice from somewhere under the figure's cloak.\n\n\"I heard him,\" sighed the figure, but there was relief in his voice.\n\nAs Drifter pushed into the crowd, he noted who was armed, who was shouting, and who was doing both. Most seemed to fit into the final category. He smiled; history had taught him the quiet ones were always the most dangerous.\n\nHe reached the center of the tight knot and found three Eliksni sitting at a table, trying to ignore the crowd around them. Undaunted, he pushed his way onto the chair arm of the biggest Eliksni like a feral cat. The Eliksni growled, but Drifter tossed Trust into the center of the table with a heavy thud.\n\nDrifter turned toward the crowd. \"What's got you fine folk all riled up tonight?\"\n\n\"Take it you don't listen to the radio much,\" someone said, and the crowd laughed.\n\n\"Places I like tend to have bad reception,\" Drifter replied. \"Tell me what I missed.\"\n\nThe group all spoke at once, a cacophony of accusations.\n\n\"Whoa!\" cried the Drifter. \"Seems like some of you been spendin' too much time starin' at that fake night.\" He turned to the Eliksni.\n\n\"Now somewhere in this commotion, I think I heard shoutin' of missing equipment. So, I've gotta ask,\" he said. \"You fellas been takin' what don't belong to you?\"\n\nThe big Eliksni spoke. His voice was deep and steady. \"We had confusions with your people. Where was self-supply and where was all-supply.\" He shrugged. \"We learned, and we compensated.\"\n\nDrifter nodded. \"Makes sense for settlin' into a new place.

I swear, it's like some folk's brains just wilt in the dark. I know Mithrax is workin' with the Vanguard to figure out this whole Vex thing,\" he said.\n\nThe Eliksni seemed to relax a bit, but Drifter held up a finger. \"I do have one question of my own,\" he said. \n\n\"We've been fightin' for a long time, your folk and mine. That's no secret. Plenty of blood spilled on both sides over the years. But I hear stories some of you fellas from the old days caught the hunger.\"\n\nThe big Eliksni shifted tensely in his seat as the crowd pressed in.\n\nDrifter leaned in closer, his voice gravelly. \"Nasty rumor even says you guys chomped on the occasional toddler.\"\n\nThe Eliksni pushed his chair back and lunged to his feet as the crowd gasped. Drifter stood his ground, somehow staring down the Eliksni that was a full meter taller than him.\n\n\"Never your young!\" the Eliksni boomed. \"Never.\"\n\nDrifter nodded. \"But the rest?\"\n\nThe Eliksni looked at the crowd, then brought his massive head close to Drifter. His voice was steady. \"We old ones, we who have been fighting since the beginning… yes. We sometimes took your dead fighters so that we could live.\"\n\n\"It was war,\" he said, and poked at Drifter's chest with a clawed finger. \"And you are made of meat.\"\n\nDrifter smiled. \"I hear you, brother,\" he said, and looked at the Eliksni's claw. \"Hell, you point that thing at me, all I can think is how good it'd taste with garlic butter. Mm-mmm!\" He leaned toward the looming creature and ran his tongue over his chapped lips. \n\nThe Eliksni sized up the tiny man, then dropped his shoulders. \"But as I say, that was long ago,\" he said. \"We are House Light now, and forever more. We have peace with your people.\"\n\nDrifter reached up and patted the Eliksni's chest. \"That's right,\" he said, and the Eliksni sat down. \"And though it don't erase the bad old days,\" he said as he turned to the crowd, \"that don't mean it's time to bring 'em back.\"\n\nA dissatisfied grumble rose from the crowd. The fight had gone out of them. \n\nThe Eliksni shrugged. \"Misraaks says we are never to eat people again,\" he said quietly.\n\nDrifter nodded. \"Yeah, Zavala tells me the same damn thing.\"\n\nThe Eliksni burst into coughing laughter.

A Ghost reduced to little more than a bare sphere of metal, deprived of a shell, hovers in the corner of the cockpit, watching the Warsat track its path across lonely Venus.\n\n\"There are no sanctioned Vanguard operations on Venus at present,\" the Ghost clarifies, pivoting its cold blue eye up to its Guardian. \"Why do you think he's down there?\"\n\nThe Warlock Shayura reclines against her seat, the old leather creaking. Her attention is not on her Ghost, but rather the Human skull sitting in the middle of her command console. Its hollow eye sockets stare back at her.\n\n\"It hardly matters why he's there,\" Shayura indicates listlessly as she examines the skull's cheekbones. Her fingers graze the microfractures—an artifact of Shotgun pellet impact. \"All that matters is we find him.\"\n\nShayura's Ghost looks away from her and focuses on Venus's soft glow in the dark.\n\n\"When will you be returning to Earth?\" he asks.\n\nShayura doesn't vocalize a response, but instead blinks and reorients her glowing-eyed stare on the Ghost. It beeps softly, reconsidering the question.\n\n\"Will you?\" the Ghost still wonders.\n\n\"No,\" Shayura answers flatly. \"There is nothing to go back to. Everyone has either abandoned me or betrayed me. All I have left is the Traveler.

The Eliksni looks the Guardian up and down, then motions to the stark silhouette of a gray concrete-block building rising up from the Venusian overgrowth.\n\n\"This ain't the academy proper,\" the Guardian says on ascent, watching the hazy sky for signs of danger. Moisture clings in glistening beads to his reflective mask; his dark hood shields him from the rest of the elements. \"The hell was this place?\"\n\nThe Eliksni tilts his head to the side, four eyes blinking independently from one another. \"Not Human, don't know. But machine inside.\"\n\n\"Why aren't your people bringing it back? Don't you folks get promotions for finding good salvage or something?\" the Guardian asks, gesturing to the crumbling building.\n\nThe Eliksni once again tilts his head, expression opaque. \"You listen to the Spider's sneak-words too eagerly. Come, we have a long walk to—\" The Eliksni's words are cut off, garbled in a wet scream as he is perforated by a barrage of Submachine Gun fire.\n\nThe Guardian turns, cloak swirling behind him and Hand Cannon at the ready. But it isn't Vex or Fallen descending from the high cliffs—it's a Guardian in black and gold armor gliding to the ground, smoke issuing from the muzzle of her SMG. Shayura's boots lightly touch the leaf-strewn plaza, her eyeless mask fixed on the chrome-clad Hunter.\n\n\"He wasn't a combatant!\" the Hunter shouts.\n\nShayura slowly approaches the Guardian. \"Did you find him within the hem of Eramis's skirt? Or did you swear yourself to the Darkness after her passing?\"\n\nThe Hunter backs away, up the stairs, Hand Cannon trained on Shayura. He recognizes her armor for what it is—a reward of the Trials. \"I know you…\" His voice quavers. \"You shouldn't be here. When did the Vanguard let you out?\"\n\n\"They didn't. I let myself out since they were too busy opening the gates for our enemies,\" Shayura indicates, motioning with the barrel of her SMG to the dead Eliksni. \"But, you know why I'm here .\"\n\n\"I know you're a few rounds short of a full clip,\" the Guardian quips back, making a flippant gesture with his Hand Cannon. In that moment of distraction, Shayura shoots him six times in two short bursts.\n\nThe Guardian collapses, his gun tumbling down the steps. A moment later, his Ghost materializes, shell flared in anger. \"What are you doing?! We—\" \n\nShayura moves like a lightning bolt, materializing beside the Ghost with an upward flourish of a sword of raw Praxic Fire. The Ghost looses a howling scream of horror as he shatters into a flurry of glittering pieces.\n\nCrumpled on the stairs, the Hunter coughs, his throat damp with blood. Shayura pulls her attention away from the shattered Ghost, training her SMG down at her quarry. \"Traitor,\" she says in a shaky, gasping breath fueled by adrenaline.\n\nThe Hunter laughs, gagging on his own blood as he does. \"You're no better than the Dredgen ,\" he says, in pain. Then, even quieter, \"…or Malphur .\"\n\n\"I killed an agent of the Darkness,\" Shayura says, and the Hunter has no rebuttal this time.

A haphazard collision of heavy canvas and metallic weave draped over its shoulders. A Vanguard lanyard dangled absurdly from its neck. \n\nIt was small for an Eliksni, but its angular head still towered above Maurice as it hunched over the bar. Four blue eyes looked back at him from above a lipless mouth. It opened, revealing rows of thin, sharp teeth. \n\n\"One item ramen soup,\" the Eliksni croaked stiltedly. \"Please.\" \n\nMaurice held his breath, tightened his grip on his pencil, and grinned. He grinned when he was nervous, and this seemed like as good a time as any. \n\nThe Eliksni grinned back, nodded, and then opened its horrible mouth again. \"I smelled it, and the smell was good,\" it said.\n\nMaurice scanned the bar. His other customers sat frozen, their bowls of ramen steaming silently in front of them. He realized his mouth had apparently decided to talk on its own, as if nothing were wrong. He heard himself ask, \"How spicy, zero to five stars?\"\n\nThe Eliksni had anticipated this question. \"Spicy five stars,\" it said, holding up one hand with three claws splayed, and another with two. \"May I receive additional dead flesh, please?\"\n\n\"You got it,\" Maurice said, his even voice betraying none of his tension, and he turned back to the bubbling pot of broth. Muscle memory took over, and he soon found himself placing a steaming bowl of ramen in front of the creature, who clucked cheerfully.\n\nMaurice took a half-step back. A small crowd was forming in the walkway in front of the restaurant. Some of the customers leaned in as their curiosity overcame their terror. Maurice noticed the woman in seat 2 needed more water, but it could wait. \n\nThe Eliksni raised its arms tentatively, then looked to Maurice again. \"What is the protocol?\" \n\nMaurice found himself unsure of which pair of the Eliksni's eyes to look into and focused on the ramen instead. \"Well, you eat the noodles and pork and egg with—\" \n\n\"Egg,\" repeated the Eliksni, enjoying the unfamiliar word.\n\n\"—yeah, egg. You eat all that with the chopsticks, and you get the broth with the spoon.\" Maurice saw how the Eliksni's claws dwarfed the ceramic spoon. \"Or you can just lift the whole bowl and drink it.\"\n\nMaurice mimed lifting a bowl to his lips. The Eliksni nodded. Its claws tapped the metal on its face and the hissing blue mist ceased. \n\nThe Eliksni held the chopsticks, tested their weight, and respectfully placed them back on the bar before bringing the bowl to its mouth with its upper arms. Above the ramen bowl, Maurice saw all four of the Eliksni's eyes close. \n\nA long moment of tension fell over the shop, the silence broken only by a staccato series of hissing slurps.\n\nFinally, the Eliksni lowered the empty bowl. It breathed in as the blue mist resumed its thin spray. It looked toward Maurice. \"I tasted all of it,\" it said with deep satisfaction. \"I am very thankful.\"\n\nMaurice's grin turned into a tentative smile. \"Glad you enjoyed it.\" \n\nThe Eliksni stood and held out what looked like a small model of the Traveler.

He has nowhere to run, cornered between a neon-lit club pulsing with the bass beats of rhythmic music and an alley blocked off by rubble left over from the Red War. \n\n\"Please, no harm. Vriiksis friend!\" he cries, two hands clutching his head, another held out flat as if it would ward the crowd off. \"Looking for brother—missing.

Vriiksis can't understand so many unfamiliar languages shouted at him at once, but he understands the tone of violence well. His posture says everything—the fear in his eyes carries additional nuance. He fears what happened to his brother. Hate begins to take root in his heart.\n\nA foundry worker steps out of the crowd, threateningly racking a round into a Shotgun.

She was running supplies from Earth to Titan. You raided it!\"\n\n\"Vriiksis does not—\" He is cut off by a blast from the Shotgun that pulverizes the street beside him.

She turns, looking at Vriiksis and offers a hand out to him. \"I'm sorry,\" she says with a tightness in her voice.

Every creak and groan of his throne becomes excruciatingly pronounced. Spider reclines against one arm, rolling a dead Ghost's shell in one hand, scraping a clawed finger across its gray, lifeless eye. The arrival of a trusted associate pulls Spider from his thoughts. \n\n\"Avrok,\" Spider bellows, turning his attention to the armored Eliksni striding through the doorway, \"what did you find?\" \n\nAvrok approaches Spider's throne, wringing his hands together anxiously. \"Our thief, my lord.\" \n\nSpider leans forward with a groan of the cables suspending his throne. \"And what did you do to them?\" he asks in greedy anticipation. That, however, is where Avrok falters. \n\n\"I did not… catch them, my lord,\" Avrok humbly answers, his much smaller frame eclipsed in Spider's shadow. \"But I have a name.\" \n\n\"Out with it,\" Spider grouses, falling back against his throne with deflated interest. \n\n\"The Crow.\" \n\nSpider's blood turns to fire. His grip tightens on that dead Ghost so hard its shell cracks. Spider continues squeezing it until the glass eye completely pops. \n\nThen he takes a moment to compose himself. \n\n\"Our little bird, come home to the nest so soon? Tell me everything.\" \n\n\"He was able to infiltrate the storehouse,\" Avrok explains, \"and coerced a team of laborers to offload cargo promised to the empress onto a Skiff, which he then… stole. Along with a cache of your more—ah—personal belongings, among which was the quantum opal.\" \n\n Avrok shrinks lower, lower, lower. \"The supplies were delivered to Mithrax. In your name. As a gift.\" \n\n\"And the workers?\" Spider growls. \n\n\"They are gone?\" Avrok doesn't mean to make it sound like a question, and regrets taking the tone immediately. \n\n\"To where, exactly?\" \n\n\"They…\" Avrok takes a small step back from Spider's throne. \"Left.\" He clenches his jaws. \"With the Crow.\" \n\nSpider slowly leans forward again. \n\n\"For Earth,\" Avrok concludes. \n\nThe Ether pipes begin to hum and rattle as a new batch begins production elsewhere in the complex. The noises rise in intensity, turning into the familiar hissing wail that joins with the uncomfortable sound of Spider. Laughing. \n\nThe Baron of the Shore throws his dead Ghost at Avrok who ducks away from it, covering his head with his hands. \n\n\"He's taking them to Mithrax,\" Spider says between fitful chuckles and wheezing coughs. \"He steals—from me—and gives it to the House of Light? Unbelievable.\" Though behind the laughter and coughs, there is a hint of appreciation in his tone. \"The kid's grown a spine.\" \n\n\"There is,\" Avrok starts, offering Spider a folded piece of paper, \"one more thing. He left this behind.\" Spider's seal is scribbled on one side. \"For you.\" \n\nAs Spider unfolds the note, Avrok creeps further away from the throne.

Along the far wall, another woman was balling up a plastic tarp. The room smelled like chemicals.\n\nA man shouldering a large black bag pushed his way past her in a cloud of cologne, alcohol, and sour sweat.\n\nHelena noticed a small signal jammer blinking orange on the table.

Refracted light from the aura of the Traveler scattered shadows on the street in unusual ways, but no one was paying attention to the shadows today. Neighbors across the street in brownstones watched movers carry furniture out of the building.\n\nThe whirr-clack of two decommissioned Generation-1 Redjacks carrying an antique chaise lounge echoed down the street. The machine noise was met with the laughter of children pursuing them in amused delight. These Redjacks no longer wore the Vanguard insignia. Instead, they displayed a serial number and the logo for a long-term storage company.\n\n\"C'mon, kids, stay out of their way,\" warned a tall, broad-shouldered woman in a worker's jumpsuit. She wore the same logo as the Redjacks, the name Sonja embroidered on one sleeve. \n\n\"How are we doing in there?\" she called into the foyer.\n\n\"Two more chairs, the armoire, and then we gotta call the Forces of the City about all the munitions,\" answered another mover inside the building.\n\nSonja sighed, fixed the two children with a warning look, and walked up the steps into the foyer of the building. Inside, she found her coworker—Maron—cataloging items in a datapad while two more decommissioned Gen-1 Redjacks idled nearby.\n\nThe munitions Maron had mentioned were significant. Boxes of ammunition piled chest high, ferroplastic cases, stacks of loose body armor, and one large Sword partly wrapped in sturdy cloth bound in buckled straps.\n\n\"This was all in her apartment?\" Sonja asked in disbelief. \n\nMaron just shook his head in response. \"Wild, isn't it? Like an armory in there.\"\n\n\"Are next of kin picking this up?\" Sonja wondered.\n\n\"She didn't have any,\" was Maron's somber response. He handed over his datapad to her, and she reviewed the checklist.\n\n\"So, what's happening to all of this? Why is it moving?\" Sonja asked as she scanned the list.\n\nMaron sighed with a shrug. \"Building owner needs the apartment vacated. There's people moving away from the neighborhoods around the, uh, Eliksni Quarter, and he wants to clean the unit up for sale. People like stuff like that—historic.\" Maron made a sweeping gesture with one hand as if motioning to a marquee overhead. \"A Guardian lived here.\"\n\nSonja looked up from the datapad with a crease in her brow. \"A literal war hero dies fighting for us, and some landlord wants to monetize her space?\"\n\n\"The hell are you yelling at me for?\" Maron complained as he turned to the Redjacks, giving them instructions on what to carry next. \"If she lived up in the Tower, I'm sure they'd have turned it into a shrine. But she didn't, and they won't.\"\n\nHe didn't wait for a response and followed the Redjacks as they carried an armoire out onto the street.\n\nSonja, left with her thoughts, looked down at the datapad again. She brushed her thumb over an item, swiped left and then down.\n\n[DELETE ITEM?]\n\nSonja clicked the green check mark. She knew where at least one item belonged, and it wasn't in a storage locker.

He eyed Saint warily, then held up a sheaf of paper like a shield. \"Manifest,\" he stated haltingly. \n\n\"Thank you,\" Amanda said with unforced brightness. She tapped her datapad. \"I've got it digitally.\"\n\n\"You got it digitally,\" echoed the Eliksni. He fidgeted for a moment, then proudly held up the badge on his lanyard, which read TEMPORARY.\n\nAmanda smiled. \"What've you got there?\"\n\n\"Authorization for unloading of supplies from Tangled Shore. Of supplies sent from Spider,\" he said. He leaned in slowly, looking carefully at Saint and Amanda. \n\n\"My gentlemen,\" he added slyly.\n\nAmanda snorted so abruptly that Saint fumbled with a lock, crushing it in his hand.\n\nSaint looked up. \"Can you two not be quiet?\"\n\n\"C'mon now,\" Amanda admonished Saint lightly. \"I don't hear you practicin' your Eliksni, and this fella's doing his best to bridge the gap.\" \n\nAmanda turned back to the Eliksni. \"That ain't exactly right, but you speak our language pretty well,\" she said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" answered the Eliksni, clearly eager for conversation. \"Do all Humans here serve Spiderkell?\"\n\n\"Serve Spider?\" Amanda spat. \"Spider's nothing but a—\" and the five spirited words that followed were replete with hard consonants. \n\nThe Eliksni froze, wary of her tone while not understanding her words.\n\nAmanda caught herself and took a breath. \"…which is our way of saying he's a kind and generous individual,\" she said to the Eliksni, who nodded along with her.\n\n\"This lock has been ruined by distractions,\" Saint said as he rose to his feet. He removed the lid and looked inside, then lifted a loose coil of rubbery tubes. \n\n\"Servitor plugs, filters, Ether circulators…\" The Titan made a confused noise.\n\n\"Something wrong?\" Amanda asked.\n\n\"Not at all,\" mumbled Saint as he picked up a small golden cylinder trailing braided sapphire cords. \"This rebreather alone is worth more than my ship.\" \n\nAmanda moved toward Saint and looked for herself. She recognized a few necessary survival items—condensed prefab ceramic plating, vapor distillers, generator couplings—but amongst the tubes and filters were otherworldly treasures: A nanomesh sphere filled with thick pink liquid. A chrome conduit splitter with entropic plating. A glimmering opal sparkling in a nest of delicate lavender sponges. \n\n\"The hell is Spider playing at?\" Amanda said to herself. She called out to the Eliksni: \"Are they all like this?\" \n\n\"Yes. Each one is very full. Full of delights, from our culture. From our home. We are very thanks.\" He cocked his head and clicked. \"Thankful?\"\n\nAmanda nodded. \"Let me see that manifest,\" she said, taking the papers from the Eliksni. He nodded and rejoined the other workers.\n\n\"They will still need many of our resources to stay here,\" Saint said as he carefully resealed the crate, \"but this will make things easier. I am surprised Spider is so generous, even to his own people.\"\n\nAmanda frowned at the manifest. \"This doesn't make sense,\" she said. \"There's a note at the top: 'Don't know what half this stuff is, but it's got to be good if Spider had it.' It's all written by hand, and there aren't values for anything on here.\"\n\nSaint looked at the papers over Amanda's shoulder. \"The crates came from Spider's storehouse,\" he said. \"If he did not send them, who did?\"\n\n\"Look at this listing!\" Amanda continued. \"This item says 'best osmosis filters (hidden in his bottom drawer).' This item is just a row of question marks. Here's one listed as 'a clock thing.' This line says 'noisy cube: smells bad but everybody likes it.' And what's with this signature?\"\n\nAmanda squinted at the shape scrawled at the bottom of the form. \"It's a… ship?\" she guessed, handing the paper to Saint.\n\nThe Titan turned his head as he looked at the drawing. \"Aha!\" he cried, slapping the paper with the back of his hand. \"Look, is bird!\"\n\nAmanda looked again at the uneven charcoal lines and could just make out a wobbly black bird. She let out a long breath and shook her head. \"Awful artist,\" she said, \"but I guess he's an all right guy.\" And suddenly, she was smiling.","name":"III - Gifts from the Shore","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/c064d2f3caf0de9fd617b2a16d9ff70d.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2920704750,"index":1730,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2920704745":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Arach Jalaal narrowed his eyes with impatience as Dead Orbit's head of logistics struggled to satisfactorily account for the faction's supply caches. The pair had been wandering around the massive Hangar for an hour while an enormous ship was being loaded in the background.\n\nJalaal had seen the celestial disappearances and the encroachment of the Black Fleet as clear signs that Dead Orbit's final exodus must soon begin. He had ordered a redoubling of departure preparations, but found the faction's rank-and-file struggling to keep pace. \n\nJalaal cut off his subordinate's bumbling presentation. \"This is insufficient. Earth will soon be behind us, and Dead Orbit will have to survive on the supplies that we provide.\" His mild tone and half-lidded gaze underscored the gravity of his words. \"Supplies that you are in charge of tracking. You do understand that, don't you?\" \n\nA furious blush spread across the administrator's face. He bowed his head and scuttled away as Jalaal crooked his head in annoyance. \n\nBehind him, a raspy voice floated up from the maze of towering crates: \"Leaving us so soon, Jalaal?\" \n\nHe turned to find Lakshmi-2 and Executor Hideo. The Future War Cult leader stood formally, hands clasped before her, while the head of New Monarchy browsed the shipping crates with casual interest. \n\n\"This is an impressive collection. I had no idea Dead Orbit was so well funded.\" Hideo gestured broadly to the crates. \n\nJalaal shrugged. \"It's a life's work, Hideo. Everything we'll need to re-seed the Human species elsewhere. You should join us.\" \n\n\"We're fine where we are, thank you,\" Lakshmi interjected. \"As a matter of fact, that's why we've come.\" \n\nJalaal bowed his head and gestured toward the Hangar exit. The trio ambled outside. \n\n\"Hideo and I are concerned about the current Vanguard leadership,\" Lakshmi began carefully. \n\nJalaal allowed himself a mirthless chuckle. \"Yes, I've heard your open editorials. You're becoming quite the demagogue. I never knew you held such strong feelings about the Fallen.\"  \n\n\"If it's incitement to speak the truth, then so be it,\" Lakshmi fired back, sharper than intended. \"The Fallen have been a useful catalyst, but that doesn't mean we are wrong.\" \n\n\"Perhaps not about the Vanguard,\" Jalaal replied, \"but the Cult is hemorrhaging members. And I doubt it's your best and brightest remaining.\" \n\n\"Those who wish to leave are free to do so,\" Lakshmi said with a pointed glance toward the Dead Orbit ship. \"We'll be stronger without them.\" \n\n\"Zavala and Ikora have been ineffective since the Speaker died,\" Executor Hideo cut in. \"The disappearance of the planets caught them unprepared. They're allowing Guardians to use the Darkness. And now they've cut a deal with the Cabal?  It's just too much.\" \n\n\"We must have leadership whose point of view is more closely aligned to that of the people,\" Lakshmi said. \n\n\"And who do you propose, exactly?\" Jalaal stopped the trio at the corner of a broad thoroughfare, where the rumble of cargo movers masked their conversation. \n\n\"Saladin was our first choice,\" Hideo added with an ill-concealed smirk, \"but he's not as cutthroat as he seems. Appears the Iron Lord has a soft spot for Commander Zavala.\" \n\nLakshmi gave Hideo a look, as though he had revealed too much. \"We are now considering Saint-14,\" she said, pointedly bringing the conversation back to the present. \n\nJalaal raised an eyebrow. \"Who else is committed to your little coup?\"  \n\n\"We have somebody in a position of influence. Someone who can ensure an orderly transfer of power,\" Lakshmi answered. \n\n\"That person would have to be very clever indeed,\" Jalaal said gravely. \"For your sake. Ikora Rey is not a target to miss.\"\n\nTh e moment stretched as Jalaal measured the situation. He had long considered what a change of leadership might mean for Dead Orbit; for the resettlement and survival of the Human species. And as always, the allure of personal power—a position of eminence in a dying society—was a constant temptation.","name":"IV - Conspirators","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/c064d2f3caf0de9fd617b2a16d9ff70d.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2920704745,"index":1731,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2920704744":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Two dozen Humans, their faces mostly covered with makeshift masks, slunk into the Botza District under cover of darkness.

If that failed, they would send a clear message that the House of Light was unwelcome in the Last City. Knives tore into banners. Noxious fumes filled the air. Paint cans rattled. The hum of the machinery around them disguised the sounds of their labor while hushed voices conferred in terse, conspiratorial tones. \n\n\"I think this is their food,\" a young woman whispered to her male companion while warily looking over her shoulder. She didn't see anyone as they crouched by a large Ether tank, but she imagined the Eliksni crowded together in a nearby building. Did they even sleep? \n\n\"Here, give me a hand with this,\" her companion said, pointing to what he guessed was a control panel. \n\nTogether they pried the face plate off, revealing a mess of wiring beneath. They shared a furtive glance and began pulling out wires by the fistful, hands shaky, their blood pounding in their ears. \n\nA low whistle like a bird call fluttered through the night air. When they looked up, a Hunter stood over them only a few paces away, his face shadowed by a cowl. He held his Hand Cannon at hip level, aimed straight at them. \n\nTheir co-conspirators, drawn by the sound, gathered in their periphery, mentally calculating their chances. Not a single one liked the odds. Even those who came armed expected to fight the Fallen, not a Guardian. \n\nThe Hunter called out in a half-whisper: \"I don't want any trouble.\" \n\nThe woman stood frozen as the young man beside her moved toward the Hunter, his jaw set. \"No!\" his companion hissed. \"Are you crazy?\" She grabbed his arm to haul him behind the ruined Ether tank, but he wrenched free. \n\nThe young man stepped slowly toward the Hunter. \"You're on the wrong side of this thing,\" he started. \n\nThe Hunter pulled back on his Hand Cannon's hammer with an audible click. \n\n\"I don't think I am,\" he replied. \n\nUnwilling to test the Hunter's mettle, the young man called over his shoulder. \"Let's go.\" \n\nThe Hunter narrowed his eyes. He watched as the young man slinked past him and spat at his feet. Something old and terrible rose up inside of the Hunter; it took all of his focus to steady his hand. \n\nThe conspirators peeled away from their hiding places, one by one, disappearing into the dark. Some hissed choice insults and dispersions at the Hunter under their breath, though none dared to look at him. \n\nIn just a few minutes, the block was deserted except for the Hunter, who stood alone in the street until his Ghost complied over his shoulder. \n\nIt chirped with concern. \"You wouldn't really have shot them, right?\" \n\nThe Hunter hesitated as he holstered his weapon. \"They needed to know I was serious, Glint.\" \n\n\"But you weren't,\" his Ghost insisted. Wordlessly, the Hunter began making his way through the destruction. Someone would sound the alarm soon—he didn't want to be there when they did. \n\n\"Tell me you weren't serious,\" his Ghost said again, lagging behind, \"…were you?\"","name":"V - SABOTAGE","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/c064d2f3caf0de9fd617b2a16d9ff70d.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2920704744,"index":1732,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2920704747":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Ikora Rey strode into the Future War Cult headquarters. It had the air of a church—hushed and reverent, but the air of sanctity was undercut by the intrusion of Vex technology. Wires climbed like vines across the ceiling, and the air was filled with the faint smell of ozone. In the middle of the room, reclining on a seat reminiscent of both throne and operating table, was Lakshmi-2. Her face was obscured by a helmet that connected to the mess of wiring above.\n\nStudious Cultists shuffled about with their heads bowed, glancing suspiciously at Ikora. As the Warlock advanced, a Cultist held up a single finger, commanding both silence and patience. Ikora's eyes narrowed. The Cultist whispered into a small microphone next to the Device. Its subaudible hum had been inconspicuous, but once it powered down, the quiet felt overwhelming to Ikora. \n\nLakshmi sat in repose, presumably orienting herself in the current timeline. \"Leave us,\" she said without opening her eyes. \"We'll resume at 14:25.\" Her subordinates filtered from the room, looking past Ikora as if she were invisible. \n\nLakshmi finally opened her eyes, and fixed them on the Warlock. \"I assume you're here to bargain.\" \n\n\"I'm not.\" Ikora's tone was calm and cold. \"I'm here to issue a warning of my own.\" \n\n\"Warn me?\" Lakshmi laughed, her voice thin. \n\n\"If we have any further incidents on account of your incitement, I will personally find a remote, icy moon to leave you on.\" \n\n Lakshmi tutted. \"Only small minds classify prophecy as provocation.\" She stood up and smoothed her garments. \n\n\"Certainty in the face of the unknown is the provenance of zealots.\" Ikora eyed the Device. \"And the insane. This isn't a debate.\" \n\n\"And yet, you are still here. Come, Ikora, you've not seen what I have.\" Lakshmi gestured to the Device. \"The Botza District under assault for a second time.

She advanced on the Cult leader. \"Cut the B.S., or suffer the consequences.

I twist inwardly with disgust.\n\nWhen they first reached for me, I reached back in acid mockery, and they opened themselves to me in stupid, naked innocence. I was giddy. My fingers raked their minds. I forced my will through them using only words and met no resistance.

But there were no vendors, no proprietors. Hideo glanced over his shoulder at the four Future War Cult security officers that followed behind them at a respectful distance.\n\n\"Do you remember the last time this street was empty?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Lakshmi said with a heavy heart. \"They called me a fool then as well.\" She did nothing to hide the contempt in her voice. \"We make mistakes in circles, Hideo.

They cannot be the leadership they need to be.\"\n\nSaint balked. \"Then why come to me?

As if she were looking for someone.\n\nShe gently pushed through the throng of people and reached out to another mourner in a white cloak.

He has been put in this warren to die.\n\n\"I can work,\" he rasps. \"I can make bandages, capes, armor lining, eggcloth, supsoak, prayer matting, watercloth. I am a weaver!\"\n\n\"Tall friend,\" one of the Winterdrekhs says soberly. \"No one your size is a weaver. Why not volunteer to fight for Eramis?\"\n\nNamrask shudders. He cannot fight. Not after what he saw in the Reef—that THING with its staff. Not after SIVA, Twilight Gap, London. Kridis promised that this was salvation.\n\n\"Bring me broken eggs,\" Namrask begs, \"and I will make eggcloth. How will the hatchlings be swaddled if no one weaves the eggcloth for them?\"\n\nThe Drekhs watch as he uses his teeth to separate the eggshell from the thin, fibrous membrane beneath. He tears it into long fibers and fastens them to his loom as the warp—the threads that run top to bottom. With two hands, he holds the loom in his lap. Carefully, he chisels open the warp with a third hand; moving too quickly will snap the eggthread.\n\nHis life depends on this. His fourth hand swiftly passes the shuttle through the warp, drawing the first weft across. The thread does not snap; he has woven.\n\n\"Watch me,\" he tells the Drekhs. \"When Eramis is done conquering our enemies, we must know how to make things.\"\n\nThey sit and watch. Their lower arms, half-grown after docking, mimic his motions. Their names are Eoriks, Oeriks, and Yriks: brother, brother, and sister.\n\nWhen it is done, he gives them the little scrap of eggcloth. They murmur in wonder and rub their cheeks against it. \"Bring that to the camp Captain,\" he tells them. \"Tell them that Namrask can weave if he is fed and given fiber.\"\n\nIt is the first time he has ever made anything without ruining it on the loom.","name":"I: Eggcloth","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/3a9a3c8279f6988746af219e3c8d203e.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2707363652,"index":1738,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2707363655":{"displayProperties":{"description":"When Namrask has the strength, he uses nonfluid loop cutters to help the Drekhs join their icy tunnels with other habitats.

A clutch of eggs is hatched, and the hatchlings are raised in the warren.\n\nFor the first time since he fled the Tangled Shore, Namrask can think of more than his own survival.\n\nThen the warrior Phylaks, a lieutenant of Eramis, comes recruiting.\n\nOn the raw ice beneath a black sky, she plays videos of Eramis raising a slab of crystal like a wall; another where she binds a Vex Minotaur in a casket of frost.\n\n\"This is the future of all Eliksni. Who among you would wield this power?\" she asks.\n\nHe keeps his head down.\n\n\"You.\"\n\nNamrask looks up, carefully. Phylaks's shock pistol is pressed to his brow. She puts the weapon down between them, a sign of truce, and makes the ireliis bow of respect. \"You have the size of an old fighter. Why not come forward?\"\n\nHe is afraid his voice will fail. It comes out strong, but like another's voice: \"I saw what happened the last time Eliksni reached for new power. And the time before that, and the time before that. I will not be part of it.\"\n\nShrugging, Phylaks takes up her pistol and walks away. \"There are many others who will take your place.\"\n\nLater, Yriks tries to change his mind, but Namrask refuses again. \"Eramis derives authority from her ability to grant this power. She cannot give it to everyone; if she does, her authority is lost,\" he says. \"Has she destroyed Servitors?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Yriks says quietly. \"Drekhtalk says that she broke a Servitor during a ritual to give power. To show that the old ways are done.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" \n\nWill society always be based on violence? Where the basic worker is not the weaver, the farmer, or the healer, but the Drekh: one pistol, one knife, one unit of labor. Employed to steal what it can—the value of a Drekh life.\n\nAnd Namrask helped make that law.\n\nHe rumbles. \"She preaches salvation, but she cannot save everyone. She keeps Ether scarce. More than we can get alone, but not as much as we need. It is the way to rule.\"\n\n\"You have a mind for strategy,\" Yriks observes slyly. \"Who were you before you became our empty weaver?\"\n\n\"Do you know hollowhot's secret?\" he asks and abruptly places some on the ground for a chattering little hatchling to play gathering-games without freezing to the ice. \"Why it is so valuable as insulation?\"\n\n\"What is hollowhot's secret, Namrask? Why is it so valuable?\" She mocks him. \n\nNamrask shows her one thread of the stuff, end-on, so she can see the little bubbles of vacuum that fill the center.\n\n\"There is nothing inside it,\" he says. \"But if you pry too hard, you break the nothing.

He is afraid that if he goes near Eramis, he will accept her gift.\n\n\"Do something,\" Eoriks begs him. \"Find us a protector. You must have known great warriors, when you were great.\"\n\n\"No,\" Namrask says again. He holds a hatchling to the heat lamp so it can bask in the warmth.

Does it suit you to be forgotten, old Smokesword?\"\n\nNamrask grinds his teeth. Laboriously, he lowers himself on all four arms. \"I come to beg a favor.\"\n\n\"No.\" Variks comes closer to whisper. \"My judgment stands, woe-of-the-masses. You gave no mercy and you will get none.\"\n\n\"You make a habit of serving queens who will abandon you,\" Namrask whispers back. \"Eramis is doomed, Variks. She is Whirlwind-touched. As I was, once.\"\n\n\"She knows what she risks. Why else would she have sent her mate and children to another star?\"\n\n\"Athrys is gone?\" Woeful news; she was Eramis's guiding glint. \"You always have a way out. I want a part of it—\"\n\n\"Now you run from battle?\" The judge's voice is light, unmocking; a sincere question. \"When Eramis could make you mighty again?\"\n\n\"I survive now as a Drekh survives.

But not an hour later, a rifle round punctures Namrask's armor. He barely staggers, but the jet of air and Ether exploding into vacuum thrust him backwards. \"A Guardian,\" he warns. \"It will call its kin.\" Guardians love to gather like carrion eaters over easily slain and looted foes.\n\nAnother round hits Namrask's helmet. \"Those with scattercloth, give me your capes!\" In exchange for the first cape, Namrask shoves his loom into a Vandal's arms. \"But this is priceless,\" she protests. \"You cannot give it!\"\n\n\"I will return for it,\" he promises. Feverishly, Namrask stitches the capes into a blanket as blood trickles down the inside of his armor.\n\nHe fires his shrapnel launcher into the ice to kick up steam: \"Like this!\" he shouts. \"Make a cloud and run!\" They shoot into the ice and flee. As the ice storm settles in Europa's low gravity, Namrask crawls towards the Guardian under a blanket of invisibility. Occasionally, he emerges long enough to be seen, so that the Guardian will hunt him instead of the others.\n\nThe Guardian comes for him. \n\nNamrask huddles against the ice, slowly freezing.

Forever remembering giving that long-ago order: Burn it. Burn it. Burn it.\n\nThe Guardian nears.\n\nNamrask melts a puddle with his armor's radiators. The Guardian uses a sword tip to test the ice at the edge of Namrask's cover. Namrask makes one small sound: I do not want to die yet.\n\nA shock pistol burst scatters off the Guardian's armor.

He wished now they had been depraved enough to think of devouring Human young.\n\nBut he sees the young Eliksni, like Eido. He wants to wail at their promise, at their hope. Eido dislikes and avoids him, which is for the best.\n\nEventually, Namrask learns to weave for the Humans. His favorite task is making felt, but he also learns to work in silk. He likes the silkmaker, and runs it manually sometimes, pulling the thread from the spinneret with one hand and then another, maintaining the steady, even tension, which makes the best fabric.\n\nHe wishes that he could weave in Light, like the Guardian Warlocks, who make fieldweave in a secret way. Maybe Misraaks will learn how to do that.\n\nOne day, a machine comes to his market stall. He combs at his shell nervously.

Zavala's desires are tangential.\"\n\nHawthorne stepped closer to Ada's workstation. \"Help me out here. I'm not super familiar with your illustrious organization's history—was the Armory born of a dream to have the world's greatest gun oven?\"\n\nAda sighed. \"The Armory was founded to stand against the Darkness, to shield humanity when we couldn't count on others to do so. The forges were simply the tools we used.\"\n\n\"So much for that grand plan. The Pyramids rolled in, and last I checked, Mars is still missing. Titan. Mercury.\"\n\n\"Did you come down here solely to antagonize me?\" Ada snipped.\n\n\"All right, all right…\" Hawthorne pleaded.  \"Look, I know we aren't friends or anything. I'm not sure you have any of those anyway—\"\n\nAda glowered.\n\n\"Right, sorry,\" Hawthorne said quickly. \"The thing is, people around here talk a big game about putting humanity first, but then it's all Guardians, all the time.\"\n\nAda nodded. \"The devotion to Lightbearers can seem fanatical.\"\n\n\"But you're not like that, Ada.\"\n\nAda shook her head. \"I appreciate the sentiment, Suraya, but I'm not sure how that relates to the forges.\"\n\nHawthorne leaned on Ada's desk. \"I think your voice is important to have around here. I want you to succeed. But you might be holding on to the past too tightly.\"\n\nAda scoffed. \"You presume to tell me how to carry the Armory's legacy?\"\n\nHawthorne gestured to the forge memorabilia strewn about the hall. \"Not at all. But your founders didn't wake up one day with forges on the brain. They started with a problem, then designed a solution as only they could.\"\n\nAda turned, her eyes thoughtful. \"And you're suggesting I'm starting with a solution instead? Limiting my view?\"\n\n\"I'm saying I would understand if it was hard to let go of all of this when it's all you've ever known.\"\n\nAda nodded. \"The idea of leaving the forges behind is admittedly unnerving.\"\n\n\"I get it,\" Hawthorne said. \"But the old methods aren't working. Maybe it's time to carry on your founders' legacy in your own way.\"\n\nAda was silent for a moment. \"I should get back to work. Thank you for your advice.\" She jutted her arm out in a stiff handshake gesture.\n\nHawthorne chuckled and clasped her hand around Ada's. \"Good luck. But maybe try to keep the noise down, okay? It bothers my bird.\"","name":"II.

The blur of open windows and doors provided brief glimpses into their new guests' lives: Strips of purple fabric filled wash basins. Jars of unknown food clinked against each other as they boiled in oversized pots while parents softly clacked their mandibles and watched their infants nestled in gently used blankets. In the distance, attendants surrounded a humming Servitor.\n\nThe guide entered a basement-level dwelling. Ada followed as they pushed through a rough cotton curtain and stood in a warm and humid room laden with myriad rugs and carpet swatches. The City's ambient glow slipped in through a singular small window while candles flickered in a pastiche of glass vessels. A series of futons had been arranged in a semi-circle in the middle of the room; there, a band of Eliksni lounged on and against the furniture, all listening to the words of a single speaker seated on the floor. The air filled with guttural clicks and low growls that Ada could make no sense of. She finally understood the performance to be over when the audience dispersed and her guide led her to sit beside the scribe.\n\n\"You're the one asking questions about Europa, are you not? About Salvation?\" the scribe said.\n\nAda frowned. \"You speak our language remarkably well.\"\n\n\"I had an unusual upbringing,\" the Eliksni replied. \"I am Eido. What do you seek, Black Armorer?\"\n\nAda sat on a futon, keeping a healthy distance from the Eliksni. \"I'm searching for information from the BrayTech facilities on Europa.\"\n\n\"And you believe we have this?\"\n\n\"I know some of your people defected from House Salvation. They may have seen something.\"\n\nEido nodded. \"They have seen many things.\"\n\n\"One of my forebearers, a great weaponsmith, worked at the Bray facilities on Europa… but I only know a fraction of what she was doing there.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Eido said. \"Always about guns.\"\n\nAda frowned. \"Your people are no strangers to weaponsmithing.\"\n\nEido inhaled. \"True. And now, improbably, both our arsenals stand together in the shadow of the Great Machine.\"\n\n\"An alliance that makes it all the more logical for you to help me,\" Ada said.\n\nEido placed her claws together. \"I will not help, because I cannot. No mentions have been made of anything related to your Armory founders.\"\n\nAda's gaze dropped to the floor.\n\nEido cocked her head and observed the Exo. \"Such despair. Maybe this is about more than guns after all?\"\n\nAda paused briefly. \"I lost something. A part of me.\"\n\nEido nodded solemnly. \"Your forges, yes?\" \n\n\"My whole existence was tied to the Armory. To those forges. Without them, I feel…\"\n\n\"Without purpose?\" Eido finished the thought.\n\nAda shook her head. \"This isn't— I'm not sure you could understand.\"\n\nEido chuckled—a guttural grunt combined with clicking teeth. \"Our history is littered with the banners of lost Houses. Most of us have worn more than one color, knelt before Kell after Kell, hoping that they would be the last.\" She leaned closer to Ada. \"Eliksni understand the fluidity of purpose very well.\"\n\n\"Fluidity implies a continuation,\" Ada replied. She sighed heavily. \"But it seems my path is coming to an end.\"\n\nClicks resonated in Eido's jaw. \"Devils was a dead House, until Eramis made it new. Mithrax was Dusk, and now, he is Light. Paths only end when we stop walking.\"\n\nAda studied the Eliksni. \"This is not the conversation I was expecting.\"\n\n\"If this settlement is going to work, it's probably best to break from old expectations,\" Eido said.\n\nAda nodded and looked at the light softly radiating through the window. \"I've taken enough of your time. Thank you,\" she said and confidently extended her arm with sincere gratitude.\n\nA clawed hand landed softly on her shoulder as the Eliksni instead thrust her datapad into Ada's outstretched hand. The befuddled Exo quickly parsed the screen.\n\n\"This is something we found in the Bray archives. It is not what you were looking for, but it may help you decide where to walk next,\" Eido said.\n\n\"I—I'll look into it, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Eido replied as Ada stood and slid the datapad under her arm. She hesitated.\n\n\"Are you sure it's a good idea to give me this? How… how will it look to your allies—you helping me like this?\"\n\nEido chittered. \"It will look like unity.\"","name":"IV.

She removed a morsel of meat from the pouch at her waist and tossed towards Louis, who gobbled it voraciously. \"So what was the answer?\"\n\n\"Centuries-old research on matter programming, left behind by a megalomaniac,\" Ada said.\n\nHawthorne whistled. \"Sounds like a trip.\"\n\n\"It has been.

So too was the half-finished Sparrow refit her new assistant was working on. But the assistant? That was taking some getting used to.\n\n\"I don't know why this is so surprising,\" Amanda said as she looked over at the Eliksni Vandal working a pair of arc-welders held in four hands. She laughed to herself, rubbing her cheek as a spark bounced off it. \"Always wondered how y'all built stuff so fast.\"\n\nThe Eliksni engineer—Niik—winked three eyes in Amanda's direction before returning her attention to the welding work. \"Easier see too. No eye-shields,\" Niik explained with a smile. \"Eliksni eyes-quick better than Human.\" Then, quieter, \"Not as much as before-home, but…\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Amanda wondered. Niik stopped welding, set her tools down, and reclined back with two hands on the concrete floor and two folded in her lap. She looked up at the ceiling and sighed a faint Ether mist.\n\n\"Story-lives greater than now-true selves,\" Niik explained, then looked sidelong at Amanda. \"We all lost purpose after…\" Niik carefully considered the proper Human words, \"…our Golden Age.\"\n\nIt was Amanda's turn to sigh, more so in regret than Niik's sigh of patience. \"You ever ridden a Sparrow before?\" she asked in an attempt to change the tone of the conversation. She hadn't considered the question before asking it.\n\nNiik shook her head and focused her attention on the half-finished machine in front of her. \"Too small,\" she said with a shrug of her upper shoulders. \"Pikes stronger, but quick-run.\"\n\nAmanda couldn't help but laugh at that. \"Darlin',\" she said through the laughter, \"ain't no Pike faster than my Sparrow.\" \n\nNiik's eyes lit up, and she sat forward at the perceived challenge. Amanda remembered the last radio conversation she had with Crow, an Eliksni phrase he used. A friendly challenge. Her pronunciation was not quite right, but the intention was. Niik delighted at the interaction.\n\n\"Your boasts are hollow-hull,\" Niik said with a growl of laughter and clambered up onto one knee. Amanda's eyes widened for just a moment when it looked like Niik was going to pounce on her. As if she had somehow said the wrong phrase or challenged the Vandal to a duel. No weapons were drawn, however. Instead, Niik offered two hands to help Amanda up from the floor; she pulled her up with ease.\n\n\"Are we gonna… race?\" she asked with a nervous flutter of laughter and crooked smile. \n\nNiik nodded enthusiastically. \"Yes, race.\"","name":"Riis Racer","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"No!

Of all his worries, this short walk had burdened him the most. His preoccupation ended with his arrival at the memorial. It was a hodgepodge of items, provided by both Humans and Eliksni. Zavala found their incongruity comforting. \n\nReaching out, he took a candle. He closed his eyes and cast his memory back to the day of her funeral. The smell of low tide and the rumble of thunderclouds on the horizon. He felt their static charge surge through the salt air and into his body. \n\nHe opened his eyes and the wick burst into flame. Zavala smiled. It was just the type of parlor trick she had always enjoyed.\n\nZavala placed the candle amongst its extinguished fellows, soothed by the tiny, flickering flame. He reached back, calling forth another memory: \n\nHer lithe form, curled under the thin blankets in contented sleep. The predawn glow seeping into the room. Her dark curls splayed across the white pillow. Her musky, floral scent. Her clothes strewn across the furniture. \n\nHe yearned to reach out and awaken her—see her drowsy smile, hear her voice.

He groaned, slid off his cot, and slumped into the pilot's chair. Large amounts of data streamed across an array of thick glass screens while the alarm blared. He connected all the various details: heavy interference on scanners, propulsion malfunction in the main drive, erroneous flags on the proximity detectors. He looked through the porthole, a glass circle no more than five inches wide, and saw wisps of blue particulates wash past.\n\n\"Collision?\" he pondered.\n\nA voice called out behind him. \"Still days out from the belt, nothing here to hit.\"\n\nEkris pivoted around and saw his copilot. He squinted, trying to remember the other Eliksni's name, but nothing came to him. He felt bad about that. They'd been in transit awhile and he still couldn't remember this one's name.\n\n\"It's Raksil,\" the copilot said as he focused on the instrument displays. \"You make that face every time you forget my name.\"\n\nEkris looked away in shame. \"Strange coincidence. Had a brother Raksil.\"\n\n\"There are many Raksil-brothers and Ekris-pilots, if you look far enough,\" the copilot said.\n\nEkris wasn't convinced that was true, but it wasn't important.\n\n\"Drive is down,\" Ekris said. \"Stuck in a field of something.\"\n\n\"Not stuck,\" Raksil said as he punched in some commands through the dash controls, stopping the alarm. \"Just slow. Velocity steady.\"\n\n\"No control…\" Ekris chittered nervously. \"If we're lucky, we'll drift out eventually.\"\n\n\"Long road just to get to Misraaks.\" Raksil sat on the bulkhead and sighed. \"You still think he's Kell of Kells?\"\n\nEkris' mind buzzed with an odd sensation. He didn't remember sharing that with his copilot.\n\n\"Best chance I've seen,\" he said. \"He is different, brings us together in new ways.\"\n\nRaksil made a click with his mandible. \"Heard that before.\"\n\nEkris waved his claw dismissively. \"You always dissent, just to be a dissenter.\"\n\n\"I want to free you from this obsession,\" Raksil replied.\n\nEkris scoffed. \"Kell of Kells is a symbol of hope for all Eliksni. You would rather we live without that?\"\n\n\"This myth divides us, brother,\" Raksil said. \"We rend and tear, trying to claw our way to the top of the mountain. Then we look down and see the mountain is made of our torn banners.\"\n\nSomething itched in Ekris's mind. Did Raksil just call him \"brother\"?\n\nRaksil continued his thought. \"The only unity down this path is collective death. The Kell of Kells is destined to rule only the House of Silence.\"\n\nEkris clicked his jaw angrily. \"Why would Eliksni dream of this Kell, if the dream only harms us?\"\n\n\"Maybe we didn't,\" Raksil said with a devilish grin. \"Maybe something else dreamt it for us. To keep us apart.\"\n\nEkris waved his claws and stood, pacing around the cabin. \"Enough. You are stretched thin by this journey; you need more sleep—go to your bunk.\" His mind itched again. There was only one cot in the ship. He stumbled as the dizziness overcame his senses. When he looked up, he was alone.\n\n\"You've chased this dream so long you've forgotten you're asleep,\" Raksil said, a hint of mourning in his voice—the sound came from nowhere in particular.

She had just left a debriefing on the previous night's sabotage of the Eliksni camp. With each detail, her blood pounded more forcefully in her ears and the Light tingled in her fingertips. Now, striding across the elevated catwalk, her temper nearly lifted her off the ground in righteous fury. \n\nSuddenly a deep, familiar voice broke through the tumult: \"Anger bends the mind, as gravity bends space-time. It's a form of distortion—useful, but dangerous.\" Ikora turned, half expecting to find Osiris standing behind her. But she was still alone. \n\n\"Like gravity, once anger reaches a critical mass, it collapses in on itself, and not even Light can escape.\" Ikora smiled to herself. Even in absentia, her mentor always knew just what to say. \n\nIkora Rey ducked into an alcove and sat with her back against the cool stone of the Tower. She closed her eyes and listened to her breath. Concentrated on slowing her heartrate. Felt her muscles loosen. \n\nOnce her body was stilled, she completed one of the many meditations Osiris taught her when she first began her training. She felt the Light moving through her body: first as a raging fire, then as a rushing river, and finally as a cool breeze. By the time she opened her eyes, her mind was clear and sharp. \n\nShe was prepared to face her opponent. \n\nII. \n\nSaint-14 was doing munitions inventory when Osiris swept into the room. Saint put down his datapad next to a crate of grenades and stood up. Osiris scanned the shelves of guns and ammo, looking for something. \n\nSaint stood dumbly, waiting for some kind of acknowledgement. When it was clear that none was forthcoming, he called out, \"Osiris. What are you looking for?\" His voice was loud and strained. \n\nOsiris didn't turn from the shelves. \"The Light suppressor that the Psions used on Zavala's Ghost. I need it for my research.\" \n\n\"Zavala kept it, I think. Ask him about it,\" Saint replied, trying not to sound put out. \n\nOsiris faced his partner, his eyes narrowed in thought. \"Very well.\" Then, as an afterthought, \"Thank you.\" \n\nAs the former Warlock turned to leave, Saint called out, \"I was hoping we could spend some time together soon. Just the two of us.\" \n\n\"Doing what?\" Osiris inquired with a small smile. \n\n\"We could fly out to the Alps,\" Saint suggested. \"Or walk around the ruins of Prague. Like we used to.\" \n\n\"That seems fine,\" Osiris said. He shrugged a shoulder. \"Provided the City doesn't burn to the ground in our absence.\" Then after a beat: \"Is that all?\" \n\nIs that all?

She had just left a debriefing on the previous night's sabotage of the Eliksni camp. With each detail, her blood pounded more forcefully in her ears and the Light tingled in her fingertips. Now, striding across the elevated catwalk, her temper nearly lifted her off the ground in righteous fury. \n\nSuddenly a deep, familiar voice broke through the tumult: \"Anger bends the mind, as gravity bends space-time. It's a form of distortion—useful, but dangerous.\" Ikora turned, half expecting to find Osiris standing behind her. But she was still alone. \n\n\"Like gravity, once anger reaches a critical mass, it collapses in on itself, and not even Light can escape.\" Ikora smiled to herself. Even in absentia, her mentor always knew just what to say. \n\nIkora Rey ducked into an alcove and sat with her back against the cool stone of the Tower. She closed her eyes and listened to her breath. Concentrated on slowing her heartrate. Felt her muscles loosen. \n\nOnce her body was stilled, she completed one of the many meditations Osiris taught her when she first began her training. She felt the Light moving through her body: first as a raging fire, then as a rushing river, and finally as a cool breeze. By the time she opened her eyes, her mind was clear and sharp. \n\nShe was prepared to face her opponent. \n\nII. \n\nSaint-14 was doing munitions inventory when Osiris swept into the room. Saint put down his datapad next to a crate of grenades and stood up. Osiris scanned the shelves of guns and ammo, looking for something. \n\nSaint stood dumbly, waiting for some kind of acknowledgement. When it was clear that none was forthcoming, he called out, \"Osiris. What are you looking for?\" His voice was loud and strained. \n\nOsiris didn't turn from the shelves. \"The Light suppressor that the Psions used on Zavala's Ghost. I need it for my research.\" \n\n\"Zavala kept it, I think. Ask him about it,\" Saint replied, trying not to sound put out. \n\nOsiris faced his partner, his eyes narrowed in thought. \"Very well.\" Then, as an afterthought, \"Thank you.\" \n\nAs the former Warlock turned to leave, Saint called out, \"I was hoping we could spend some time together soon. Just the two of us.\" \n\n\"Doing what?\" Osiris inquired with a small smile. \n\n\"We could fly out to the Alps,\" Saint suggested. \"Or walk around the ruins of Prague. Like we used to.\" \n\n\"That seems fine,\" Osiris said. He shrugged a shoulder. \"Provided the City doesn't burn to the ground in our absence.\" Then after a beat: \"Is that all?\" \n\nIs that all? Behind his helmet, Saint frowned. \"I suppose.\" \n\nOsiris strode from the room, leaving Saint alone with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. \n\nIII. \n\nLakshmi-2 watched Osiris from across the bustling courtyard. Of all the political creatures in the Tower, he was the one that troubled her most. \n\nHer concern was not a matter of the ex-Warlock's unpredictability. In fact, it was just the opposite. \n\nThe Device had no trouble parsing his arrogant brilliance—his every move was well within the standard deviation. \n\nYet for someone with a legendary reputation as an eccentric, his every move as of late had been shockingly moderate.
